==============================================================================
                            Intro: About Sea Dogs
==============================================================================


   Welcome to the world of Sea Dogs!  In this game, you will play the role of 
Nicholas Sharp, Captain of the Principio.  Your story begins when your mother
hands you a medallion that used to belong to your father.  Apparently, the 
desire to sail the high seas runs in the family.  Your father, whom you know
nothing about, set sail from home one day, but never returned.  And so you 
begin your life as a Captain.

   During one voyage, you were sailing with a cargo of cannons when you were
beset upon by Spainards who captured you and your ship.  You were later sold
as a slave to a landowner.  However, you were able to make your escape.  Along 
with some other men, you managed to steal a Spanish Pink and sail away.  Your 
initial plan is to sail to highrock, an English island, and ask for a Letter 
of Marque.  However, plans are always subject to change, and it may be that 
you end up seeking a Letter of Marque from another country, such as France.  
Or perhaps you will seek the forgiveness of Spain and join their ranks.  You 
may even tire of the traditional nations and decide to become a full-fledged 
Pirate!  Perhaps you will seek after your father, trying to discover what 
became of him.  Or it is possible that you will decide to pursue your own 
future, seeking to become nobility within one of the European nations.  These 
choices are yours to make.  If you do not like your initial choice, change it!  
The future is yours to shape.  Sail to it!



==============================================================================
                            Locations in Sea Dogs
==============================================================================


   There are several interesting and potentially dangerous locations in the
Archipelago.  Some of them have already been settled by the four prominent
people groups: the English, the Spanish, the French, and the Pirates.  There
are other islands that remain unsettled, or even unexplored!  Anything could 
be on those islands.  Each of the four people groups above have settled some 
of the islands in the Archipelago.  Below is a listing of the islands that you
can visit.  They are in alphabetical order, and are grouped according to
the nation that runs them.  After the list of populated islands, I have placed 
the remaining islands.  Under the name of each island is a description.  This
description comes straight from the game.


                              =================
                               English Islands
                              =================

Dead Island
-----------
   "An inhospitable and unfertile island, Dead Island was colonized by
Englishmen only because it was within striking distance of the Spanish 
"Golden Way" and main Spanish colonies."


Highrock
--------
   "This island was called Highrock, because there was a mountain on it, when 
island was explored. Then earthquake partially deformed island landscape fifty 
years ago, but island is still very rocky."


Itkal
-----
   "Small, mysterious isle believed to be cursed by the natives of 
Archipelago. Once a sudden tornado destroyed all the landing boats with 
English explorers who made for shore to take some water."


Tendales
--------
   "Tendales a beautiful, fertile land and a strategically important location. 
Its huge protective cliffs can shelter whole fleets from cruel storms, and its 
single, narrow passage can be vigorously defended from assault."


                               ================
                                French Islands
                               ================

Belflor
-------
   "This island is known as "the fun island" in Archipelago, due to the 
relaxed atmosphere of its residents. For sailors weary after a long voyage, 
the taverns and brothels of this jolly island are a welcome sight."


Isle d'Orange
-------------
   "A French colony with the most fertile island in Archipelago. It is known 
in Archipelago as a paradise on earth due to its mild, warm climate and 
abundant fruit groves."


Omory
-----
   "Because the island's contour is very open, settlement on Omory is exposed
to all storms and winds. Therefore, Omory's berth is very dangerous in
storms."


Tchia Hoa
---------
   "On this island lived old maroon, who built a tower on the island to get 
attention of any ship, which would enter those waters. People say he got mad 
of loneliness. Unfortunately, maroon died right after a ship took him 
onboard."


Tel-Kerrat
----------
   "Tel-Kerrat is small island, settled with small party of colonists. It is
completely useless for political and military purpose, and only merchants 
visit Tel-Kerrat."


                               ================
                                Pirate Islands
                               ================

Gray Sails
----------
   "These rocky, forbidding islands aside the major shipping routes for Spain 
and France became a base for any disgruntled or indifferent captains from 
England, France, and Spain. Two pirate settlements are said to have been 
founded here during the colonization of Archipelago."



Shark Island
------------
   "These rocky, forbidding islands aside the major shipping routes for Spain 
and France became a base for any disgruntled or indifferent captains from 
England, France, and Spain. Two pirate settlements are said to have been 
founded here during the colonization of Archipelago."


                              =================
                               Spanish Islands
                              =================

Costa Sinistra
--------------
   "Beggar shore is the translation of this island's given name, it was so
named due to the misfortune that pursued the first settlers upon their 
arrival. Half of them met their end due to drought and starvation."


El Caimano
----------
   "The unfortunate explorer who first located this island was eaten by caiman 
when he left camp to answer nature's call. His companions killed the giant 
reptile and called this island El Caimano."


Granda Avilia
-------------
   "Granda Avilia is situated in the very center of The Archipelago. It is a
tasty morsel for every nation on these Islands, but perfect Spanish cannons on 
solid fort defend Avilia well."


Isla Ballena
------------
   "Isla Ballena is situated near the Spanish "Golden Way". This is the common 
route that Spanish galleons loaded with gold use to sail to Spain. It is
boasted that he who controls this island, controls the "Golden Way"."


                             ===================
                              Unclaimed Islands
                             ===================

Aliando
-------
   "This small piece of earth remains uninhabited as it is too small to
interest European powers as a potential colony. Why natives do not live 
there - no one knows. Only pirates favor Aliando, using its sheltering shoals
as discreet location to divide plunder."


Chaktcha
--------
   "Chaktcha is well known for the story of an old marooned captain, who built
a tower on the island to get attention of any ship. Upon his rescue twenty 
years after his misfortune, the captain died right after a ship took him 
onboard."


Emuno
-----
   "On a small volcanic island called Emuno there remained ruins of an ancient
pagan temple. People say that it is not a best place for Christians for living 
and sailors say that it's not too safe even to sail close. Superstition... 
maybe."


Inachetla
---------
   "The northern island in Archipelago. Near it lies the "Golden Way". Spanish 
galleons deliver gold and jevels this way to English plantations this way.
Sometimes, the pirates ambush Spaniards there."


Telltak
-------
   "Uninhabited island with strange, odd contour. From a bird's eye-view it
looks like cow's head. In other aspects it is usual piece of land."



==============================================================================
                                Types of Ships
==============================================================================


   Ships are, undoubtedly, the single most important part of Sea Dogs.  What's
a Pirate without a ship?  Or an Admiral, for that matter?  There are many 
different types of ships available to a potential Captain in Sea Dogs.  One 
aspect that is important to ships is that of Class.  Each ship has a Class 
number between 1 and 7.  Ships with a Class of 1 are the most powerful ships 
in the game, while ships of Class 6 are the weakest.  There are only two ships
that are Class 7; these ships do not even have cannons!

   Another important concept that is related to Ship Class is that of Captain
Rank.  As a Captain, you must have a certain Rank to be able to sail a given
ship.  If you do not have this minimum Rank, you will still be able to sail
it, but you will receive penalties.  So it is best to restrain yourself to
sailing ships that correspond to your Rank.  Your Rank will change with
experience; every new level of experience increases your Rank by 1.  You start
the game at Rank 12.  Rank 1 is the highest (notices that the Rank numbers
DECREASE as you gain levels.  This is not an error).  For every 2 levels of
experience that you gain, you will be able to command a higher Class of ship.
Here is a list of Captain Ranks and their corresponding ship Classes:


   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Rank 12 - Command Class 6 Ships.       Rank 6 - Command Class 3 Ships.
    Rank 11 - Command Class 6 Ships.       Rank 5 - Command Class 3 Ships.
    Rank 10 - Command Class 5 Ships.       Rank 4 - Command Class 2 Ships.
    Rank  9 - Command Class 5 Ships.       Rank 3 - Command Class 2 Ships.
    Rank  8 - Command Class 4 Ships.       Rank 2 - Command Class 1 Ships.
    Rank  7 - Command Class 4 Ships.       Rank 1 - Command Class 1 Ships.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------


   For information regarding how many experience points are needed to reach a
specific Rank, please see the section entitled "Experience Point Chart" near
the end of this document.

   There are two ways to obtain a ship in Sea Dogs.  One way is to enter a
Shipyard and buy one.  Be aware that you are only allowed to own one ship at a
time, so you will have to sell your current ship before purchasing the new
one.  Also, BE SURE that you will have enough money after the sale to buy a
ship.  If you do not, you are stuck with a cannonless fishing boat.  Not a
good way to become the scourge of the seven seas...  A second, and much more
popular way to obtain a new ship is to capture one!  If you successfully board
a ship on the Open Seas and defeat its Captain in a duel, you will have the
option to Change Ships.  On this screen, you will be presented with the vital
statistics for both your current ship as well as the ship you have just
taken over.  Furthermore, once you find yourself a First Mate, you will be 
able to Take Prize Ship, which allows you to keep your original ship AND the 
new one!  However, if it is sunk, you will lose your First Mate.  This is a 
BAD thing!  Once you have taken a Prize Ship, you should sail it to a Shipyard 
and sell it for a lot of gold.

     NOTE: If you fully repair a damaged Prize Ship BEFORE you sell it, you 
           will receive a bit more gold than if you had sold it while damaged.

   One more aspect of Ships that I have not mentioned up until now are the 
cannons.  With the exception of the Tartana, all ships have cannons.  Cannons
come in three different types:

      Demi-culverine  (12 lbs)
      Culverine       (16 lbs)
      Demi-cannon     (24 lbs)

   The weight of each cannon will affect a number of things, including their
firing range and reload time.  More information regarding cannons can be found
in the section entitled "Naval Warfare", which is found before the main game
walkthrough.

   There is a total of 22 different types of ships in the game, according to
the manual.  Within each type of ship are different varieties (Armored,
Plated, Modernized, etc.).  Below, I have provided information on all the
ships available in the game. On the left side, I have included the ship's
vital statistics. (Hull Strength, Maximum and Minimum Crew, etc.)  On the
right side, I have included a description of the ship.  The statistics for each
ship come straight from the chart at the end of that game manual, while the 
descriptions of each ship are found within the game itself.  The ships are 
listed in alphabetical order, according to their type (so if you are looking

                                   enemies are its great bulk and size. It is
                                   less manueverable than lighter ships and is
                                   too large to enter shallow ports or

  Name: Armored Battleship         "Using the same design as the battle-tested

  Minimum Crew: 140                best woods throughout its construction.
  Speed Rate: 10.00                Although this gives the ship greater

  Turn Rate: 35                    using Caravels. Caravels are best utilized
  Hit Points: 2,500                in carrying heavy loads, and as such, its

  Name: Light Caravel              "Light Caravels were designed to be faster

if you are patient, and are willing to sail all over the Archipelago.
Furthermore, having an Officer aboard your ship who excels in Commerce can
help to increase profits!

   Included here are the goods that you will encounter throughout the course
of your journeys.  The goods can be divided into two categories:  Cannon Shot
and Trade Goods. There are a total of 4 types of Cannon Shot, and 12 types of
Trade Goods.  Under the name and weight of each item is a description of the
item.  These descriptions come directly from the game, and are not my own
invention. So without further ado, the goods!

   For a complete lists of prices for every Store, see the section entitled
"Store Prices" near the end of this document.


                                =============
                                 Cannon Shot
                                =============

Bombs - Weight: 3 cwt (for 20)
------------------------------
   "As one of the most advanced forms of ballistics available, bombs are the
most destructive and expensive type of shell. Essentially an iron ball
carefully packed with gunpowder and sheathed in a flaming shroud, bombs
detonate on impact in an explosion of shrapnel, inflicting heavy damage on
hull, rigging and crew."


Cannonballs - Weight: 3 cwt (for 20)
------------------------------------
   "The cannonball is the most reliable, affordable and abundant type of
cannon round available, and as such, no captain should set sail without an
ample surplus aboard. A simple, round piece of cast-iron, cannonballs are
useful for all manner of offensive and defensive salvos, but are best used to
breach hulls and assault fortifications."


Grape - Weight: 2 cwt (for 20)
------------------------------
   "Essentially small round balls, packed tightly into the ship`s cannons,
grapes are designed to inflict massive casualties on enemy crew. With a very
short range and dubious accuracy, it is preferable to use grapes in broadsides
when crippling a ship for boarding."


Knippel - Weight: 5 cwt (for 20)
--------------------------------
   "Invented for the sole purpose of damaging an opponent's sails and rig,
chain-shot consists two cast-iron balls fastened together with chain or iron
bar. When fired, the shot rotates whilst airborne, ripping holes in sails and
cutting masts, reels and rope with ease. Though devestating against rigging,
chain-shot is almost useless against an opponent's hull."



                                =============
                                 Trade Goods
                                =============

Chocolate - Weight: 2 cwt
-------------------------
   "One of the most important discoveries within the Archipelago has been the
modest cocoa plant. Refined into chocolate, it is highly prized by the rich
for its seductive flavor, and is a profitable cargo throughout many of the
islands. It is not uncommon to find merchants who fill their ship`s hold with
only chocolate."


Coffee - Weight: 2 cwt
----------------------
   "Because of its unusual taste, cheering effect, and pleasing aroma another
natural resource that has proven its worth as a trade good is coffee. In spite
of difficulty of manufacturing, coffee production has grown rapidly to meet
demand in continental Europe."


Ebony - Weight: 6 cwt
---------------------
   "A rich, dark, hardwood, ebony is prized for its strength, resistance to
burning and exquisite color. Often shaped into delicate polished furniture
that finds residence in the homes and boudouirs of the rich and royal, ebony's
worth as a trade good is almost as good as gold."


Linen - Weight: 3 cwt
---------------------
   "Produced from flax which grows in the Archipelago's rich agricultural
lands, this firm, thick linen is used for sewing anything, from shirts and
camisoles to (especially important) sails."


Mahogany - Weight: 4 cwt
------------------------
   "An very expensive and strong wood used in high-quality furniture, mahogany
is prized for its exotic properties. It does not rot, buckle and it is
difficult to burn. Though rare, it is not unheard of to use mahogany on ship
hulls."


Planks - Weight: 4 cwt
----------------------
   "Pre-sawn boards of hardwood, useful for repairing damage to a ship's hull
or deck. For repairs to occur automatically, there needs to be at least one
point assigned to the repair skill."


Rum - Weight: 1 cwt
-------------------
   "Strong, fragrant rum is a favorite drink of sailors and pirates. The rum
trade is very profitable, because it is cheap to produce and is always in
demand."


Sailcloth - Weight: 3 cwt
-------------------------
   "If you have a reserve of thick and firm sailcloth in your ship's hold,
your crew will be able to repair sails damaged by a storm or enemy shots.
Notice that your Repair Skill must be more than one to start repair of your
ship's sails."


Sugar - Weight: 2 cwt
---------------------
   "With an abundance of sugar cane plantations within the Archipelago,
processed sugar is a common trade item. Produced by boiling sugar cane, it
isn`t as flavorful as white-beet sugar, but it is much cheaper, and is rising
in popularity. Unfortunately, sugar is difficult to convey by ship, because it
soaks up water badly."


Tobacco - Weight: 4 cwt
-----------------------
   "Aromatic tobacco leafs... What can be better friend for a sailor than a
pipe?  Tobacco came from new colonies and soon became very popular as a
favorite relaxation remedy in Continental Europe."


Wheat - Weight: 2 cwt
---------------------
   "With fertile and abundant land throughout the Archipelago, wheat has
become a major staple of merchants. Processed into wheat flour it is used to
bake the delicious loafs and buns."


Wine - Weight: 2 cwt
--------------------
   "Colonists learned how to grow grapes on the fertile soil of these newly
opened lands. Now the wine from the archipelago has become a very valuable
product. Though it hasn`t the same precise, delicate taste as European
vintages, it has a strong and sweet flavor that is well in demand."



==============================================================================
                            Skills & Skill Points
==============================================================================


   Skill Points are one of the most important aspects in the game.  Skill 
Points, which are received every time you gain a new experience level, allow 
you to improve one or more of your skills.  There are two ways to improve your 
skills throughout the course of the game:

      1. Spend your Skill Points on one or more Skills.
      2. Hire Officers.  They will also improve one or more of your Skills.

   There is nothing preventing you from using both of the above methods.  In 
fact, you can only reach the absolute maximum Skill levels by using a 
combination of Officers and Skill Points.  The maximum amount of Skill points 
you can put in a single Skill is 9.  However, if you hire an Officer that adds 
to that Skill, he will take it above 9.  The highest bonus that any Officer 
adds to a single Skill is +3, so the absolute maximum possible score for any 
single Skill is 12.

   You receive Skill Points regularly each time you Level Up.  Note that you
start the game with available Skill Points.  The game will not tell you this;
Press F1 to go to your information screen.  The number of Skill Points you
receive depends on the difficulty level you are playing.  If you are playing:

      Easy - 5 Skill Points per level.
      Medium - 3 Skill Points per level.
      Hard - 3 Skill Points per level.

     NOTE: Different difficulty levels were added with a new Patch.  They are
           not part of the original game.  See the section entitled "Things
           You Should Know" for help on finding the latest Patch.

   By pressing F1, you can bring up the Status screens.  On the right hand
side, you will see a list of the different Skills.  Notice that there are
arrows next to the top and the bottom of the list.  Not all of the Skills are
displayed on the screen at once!!  You will miss out on two of the more
important Skills if you do not scroll down the list!  Below I have listed the
various Skills that you can improve.  Included with each is a description;
this description comes straight from the game.  Also included with each Skill
are the names of the Officers that you may encounter throughout the game that
can add to (or subtract from) that particular Skill.  The Skills are listed in
alphabetical order.

   See the section entitled "Officer Statistics" near the end of this document
for more information regarding Officers.



==============================================================================
                              Officers and Crew
==============================================================================


   Officers are an important part of the game.  As mentioned in the previous
section, Officers add bonuses to your Skill Levels.  You can hire Officers at
many of the towns throughout the Archipelago.  Taverns are particularly
popular hangouts for Officers.  There are 6 different positions that can be 
filled by Officers on your ship.  I have listed them below, in alphabetical 
order.  Under each position is a description, which comes directly from the 
game.


                               ===============
                                Officer Types
                               ===============

Boatswain
---------
   "Some say boatswains are born aboard a ship. Their skill in handling them, 
and the crew, are certainly indisputable. A Boatswain will help a Captain get 
every bit of speed, turning rate, and maneuverability possible from his ship."


Carpenter
---------
   "Skilled in the art of woodwork, carpenter can repair hull damage from
storms and battle, often beginning his work moments after the damage has
occured. A quality Carpenter knows exactly what to repair in order to keep the
most heavily damaged ship afloat."


First Mate
----------
   "The First Mate serves as the Captain's right-hand man in all affairs of
the ship. He is the captain's most trusted officer and assists him with the
sailing and command of the ship, including crew members, other officers, and 
their duties."


Master Gunner
-------------
   "The skill and experience of a Master Gunner can quickly turn the tide of 
battle. His mastery of the art of war allows for more accurate firing of the 
ship's guns. The Master Gunner also ensures that the guns are protected safely 
from the elements, lest they be damaged."


Master Purser
-------------
   "A Master Purser's duty is to manage the ship's hold and all the goods it
contains. In addition, the Master Purser is also a shrewd trader and helps the 
Captain obtain the best buying and selling price when trading with others."


Surgeon
-------
   "Surgeon must take care of crewmen injured in the course of battle. His 
duty is to amputate extremities, sew wounds, and provide other medical
assistance. A good Surgeon can be the difference between life and death for 
your crew."


   Note that it is NOT necessary to hire each type.  It is not even necessary 
to hire any of them in order to complete the game.  However, the most valuable 
type of Officer is, without a doubt, the First Mate.  The First Mate allows 
you to Take Prize Ship.  You can then sail your new ship (along with the old 
one) to a town that has a Shipyard.  There, you can sell one of the ships for 
a massive profit (typically between 3,000 and 30,000gp depending on the Class 
of ship, as well as its condition).


                                ==============
                                 Crew Members
                                ==============

   In addition to Officers, you can hire Crew Members to serve aboard your
ship.  Unlike Officers, however, you NEED Crew Members in order to sucessfully
run a ship.  Each ship has a maximum and minimum crew number.  To ensure that
the ship runs at its full potential, you should make sure that your Crew is as
close to the maximum crew limit as possible.  If the number of crew members 
you have aboard your ship is close to, or under the minimum number for that 
ship, everything will suffer.  Cannons will reload MUCH slower.  Your ship 
will sail and turn slower, as well.  Finally, you will leave yourself open to 
other ships who would like nothing better than to board you and steal your 
ship!

   You can hire more Crew Members in any town that has a Tavern.  Whenever you 
are in a Tavern, press F1.  In the bottom center of the screen is the number 
of crew members that currently serve aboard your ship.  Underneath this number 
is a hire button.  Press it, and it will come up with the total number of 
possible recruits in the Tavern (note that this number fluctuates greatly - I
have seen as low as 11 and as much as 708).  Like Officers, you must pay the 
first month's salary up front for crew members.  Each crew member costs 5 
gold.  One thing to keep in mind is that you need to have adequete funds
available to continue paying your crew in the coming months.  Failure to pay 
your crew will result in a loss of Reputation (-5 points).  If your Reputation 
is poor and you continue to withhold payment, the crew and Officers may 
mutiny.  This results in your untimely death, as well as the end of the game.



==============================================================================
                                Naval Warfare
==============================================================================


   Once you get acquainted with the basic controls and ideas that are vital to 
the game, you will eventually feel the desire to test your might at sea.  It 
is important to realize that, at the beginning of the game, you are in control
of one of the weakest ships.  You can not pick a fight with any ship you wish
and expect to win.  For starters, DO NOT ATTACK ALLIES!  Your Reputation will
plummet (-25 points).  You are allied with whatever nation gave you your
Letter of Marque (more about this item later).  Second, you should understand
the difference between ship Classes before engaging an enemy.  For example,
you should probably not attempt to fight a Corvette (Class 3) while you are
sailing a Pink (Class 6).  If it is your first time playing Sea Dogs, it will
take some time to get used to controlling your ship.  This is another reason
to restrict yourself to attacking only weak ships in the beginning.  A final
reason not to attack anything that floats is that, even if you win a battle
early on, your ship will almost certainly be damaged.  You will not start the
game with a lot of money; damaging your ship early on only causes your gold to
disappear more quickly.  You are better off completing some of the initial
quests and tasks that people send you way.


                             ===================
                              Skills and Combat
                             ===================

   Your Skill Points can play a major role in Captains who rule and Captains
who sink.  Your Skills can improve the aim of your cannons, allow you to board
ships from safer distances away, and survive brutal fencing duels with enemy 
Captains.  Different Skills will prove to be more useful than others, 
depending on what you want to achieve in a battle.  Here are some tips on 
effectively choosing the most beneficial Skills, with regards to effective 
Naval Combat:


Boarding
--------
   In the beginning of the game, you are unable to capture and sell
enemy ships.  Also, you have only a small cargo hold with which to work.  
This will prevent you from taking a lot of loot from ships.  Therefore, in
the early stages of the game, Boarding is not vital.  Put a point or two in
during your first 3 Level Ups.


Commerce
--------
   This Skill is the least useful, with regards to combat.  In fact, I have
never put a single point in this Skill.  If you really want points in this
Skill, it might be more beneficial to just hire a Purser.  This will free up
more Skill Points for other Skills.


Coordination
------------
   There are three key Skills for surviving any Naval Battle.  This is the
least important of the three, but it is still quite useful.  In the early
stages of the game, having all of your cannons fire at EXACTLY the same time
is not as important as how accurate they are, or how fast they reload.  Wait
until you have high Gunlaying and Reloading stats before investing Skill
Points here.


Defence
-------
   Defence is an important Skill.  In my opinion, it is the 4th most important
Skill.  Essentially, this Skill prevents your crew from being slaughtered
every time the enemy decides to use Grape on you.  Having as many crew members
as possible is very important for winning duels with enemy Captains.  It is
also very important for the Reloading speed of your cannons.  You may want to
consider putting at least 1 point in this skill during your first 4 Level Ups.
In addition, you will want to hire a Surgeon (there is one Surgeon who will 
sail with you for free, after you complete the relevant quest).


Grappling
---------
   This Skill is tied to Boarding.  It becomes more useful later in the game,
when you will want to board and capture as many ships as possible.  Wait until  
after your first 4 Level Ups before putting any Skill Points here.


Gunlaying
---------
   This is the most important Skill in the game!  It will increase the 
accuracy of your cannons.  This will allow you to sink powerful ships quickly.  
Think of a maxed out Gunlaying score as bringing a sniper rifle to a blind
man's duel. This is one Skill that you will want to put the full 9 Skill 
Points into.  Do so as quickly as possible!


Reload
------
   This Skill is closely related to Gunlaying.  So it will come as no surprise
that this is the other Skill that you will want to place the full 9 Skill
Points in.  Reloading affects how fast it takes your crew to reload cannons.
This should be the second Skill to reach level 9. Think of a maxed out 
Gunlaying score as bringing an Uzi to a musket fight.


Repair
------
   Repair allows your crew to repair hull and rigging damage while out on the 
open sea.  However, you must have adequate supplies of Sailcloth and Planks in
your cargo hold.  I found this Skill to be useful during the early stages of 
the game.  As the game progresses, you will be sailing large ships that take 
much time and many materials to successfully repair.  I recommend placing 1 
Skill Point in this Skill.  You can complement this by hiring a Carpenter.


Sailing
-------
   Last, but not least, is Sailing.  Sailing improves your crew's ability to
steer and more your ship.  I consider this a mediocre Skill, neither worthless 
nor vital.  There are two First Mates in the game; they will increase your 
Sailing Skill by either +2 or +3, depending on which one you hire.  If you 
have a spare point after Gunlaying and Reloading are maxed out, you may want 
to invest 1 or 2 points here.


   So, in conclusion, here is how I would rank the various Skills in the game, 
as far as overall impact and importance (1 is the most vital, while 10 is the 
most useless):

      1. Gunlaying       6. Coordination
      2. Reloading       7. Sailing
      3. Boarding        8. Repair
      4. Defence         9. Commerce
      5. Sailing



                                =============
                                 Cannon Shot
                                =============

   As I have already stated, cannons are a key element in ensuring victory on 
the high seas.  But cannons are useless without shot.  Shot refers to the ammo 
that the cannons use.  In Sea Dogs, there are 4 different types of Shot that 
you can use to cause your enemy grief.  Each one serves a specific purpose.
In general:

      Bombs - Good against anything; great for attacking fortresses.
      Cannonball - Good for sinking ships.
      Grape - An excellent way to quickly reduce the enemy's crew number.
      Knippel - This Shot will shred a ship's sails, thus slowing them down.

You will begin the game with limited amounts of each type of Shot.  Do not be
too concerned; you will not use up your ammo too quickly, since you only have
a few cannons.  It is important to know what each type of Shot is used for,
otherwise you might sink a ship that you are trying to board.  Below are the
four types of Shot that you will have access to in the game.  In addition, I
have included information regarding the amounts of damage that each shot does
to a ship's Hull, Rigging, and Crew.  Each type of cannon (12, 16, and 24
pounds) have a different maximum range.  The percentage that appears next to
each shot indicates the maximum range each Shot is effective at.  This
information comes directly from a chart at the end of the game manual.

     Example: Grape has a 50% modifier.  If the maximum range on a 12-pound

                    =====================================
                     Spyglasses: A Captain's Best Friend
                    =====================================

   When you encounter an enemy ship, (or 2, or 3...or 9) it is very important
to know everything you can about your enemy.   You can judge this, to some
extent, using your own vision.  If the ship is REALLY big, it is probably
going to rip your own ship to shreds, unless you also sail a large ship.
This is where the spyglass comes in.  You can use the Spyglass from a distance
to determine how strong your enemy is.  But not all Spyglasses are equal!
Some of them will tell you more information than others.  In order to use your
Spyglass, you must be in first-person mode.  Assuming that you did not switch
the controls around before starting the game, you can change between first-
and third-person views by pressing the "Q" key.  From the first-person view,
press and hold the Spyglass button (I believe it is the Ctrl button).  Center
the mark that appears on a ship, and you will gather some information about
it.

   In the course of gaming, I have discovered 3 different types of Spyglasses.
They are:

      Ordinary Glass
      Good Glass
      Superior Glass

   You begin the game with an Ordinary Glass.  There is a quest within the
game that will let you obtain the Superior Glass.  This quest is available to
you no matter which nationality you decide to play (although it will be more
costly for some nationalities than for others).  If you are very lucky, you
can also find a Good or Superior Glass after successfully boarding an enemy
ship.  Once you have a Glass, you need not fear losing it.  Also, if you find 
a better Glass than the one you currently have, you will automatically use the 
better Glass.  Each Glass will tell you a certain amount of information about 
the enemy ship.  Below I have recreated the information bar that appears for 
each of the 3 Glasses.

                               ================
                                The Spyglasses

                             Basic Naval Tactics
                            =====================

   So you have stocked up on different types of Shot, you have studied which
one is best used in a given situation, you have obtained a Spyglass and now
know your enemy's strengths and weaknesses.  First you should learn the basics
of your ship.  More specifically, you should know where your cannons can
strike the enemy, and where they can not.  Notice the figures below:


                                   /\
                                  /  \
                                 /    \
                                /      \
                                |      |
                        <------ o      o ------>
                                |      |
                        <------ o      o ------>
                                |      |
                        <------ o      o ------>
                                |      |
                        <------ o      o ------>
                                |      |
                                \_o__o_/
                                  |  |
                                  |  |
                                  |  |
                                  V  V


   Notice the following:

      1. You can not fire forward.  Therefore, do NOT let the enemy get in 
         front of you.  If he does, he will be able to fire on you without 
         fear of your cannons.
      2. The majority of your cannons are on either side of your ship, with
         only a couple in the rear.  Make sure that you use your side cannons 
         as much as possible.
      3. The best possible situation is when your broadside cannons are in 
         the front of his ship.  The enemy will not be able to fire back.  
         This is called Raking.

   Now all you need to learn are a few basic tactics which will prove useful
during battle.  To start off, there are a few terms which you should learn.
They are not included in the game manual, but I will use them in this section.
They are:

      Broadsides - The broadside of your ship is the long side.  Here is where
                   your cannons are located.  Fighting at Broadsides is when
                   you and your enemy are parallel to each other.  Each ship's
                   cannon's are aimed directly at the broadside of the other
                   ship.  The advantage here will go to whichever ship can
                   reload the fastest, possesses the greatest amount of
                   cannons, and hit with the greatest accuracy.


                            Example of Broadsides
                            =====================
                                       
                                               ______
                          /\                  /      \
                         /  \                 |      |
                        /    \        <------ o      o
                       /      \               |      |
                       |      |       <------ o      o
                       o      o ------>       |      |
                       |      |       <------ o      o
                       o      o ------>       |      |
                       |      |       <------ o      o
                       o      o ------>       |      |
                       |      |               \      /
                       o      o ------>        \    /
                       |      |                 \  /
                       \_o__o_/                  \/


          Raking - Raking is when a ship has maneuvered itself into a position 
                   where it can fire its broadside cannons from either in 
                   front of or from behind a ship.  In the first situation, 
                   the other ship will be unable to fire back (cannons do not 
                   fire forward).  In the second situation, the defender will 
                   only have the use of a couple of cannons.  Unlike 
                   Broadsides, Raking is a tactical advantage.  The advantage 
                   does not come from the number of cannons or the reload 
                   rate, since the other ship can not fire back, or can only 
                   fire a minimal number of cannons.

   Now that you know the basics of ship positioning, there is only one more 
thing left to mention.  Wind will play a very important role in any naval 
battle.  Depending on which direction your ship is pointing, you may find 
yourself sailing into the wind, with the wind, or at an angle.  Try hard to 
avoid sailing INTO the wind during a battle; this slows you down considerably.  
A slow ship is easier to hit.  So whenever possible, look for ways to sail 
WITH the wind or, better yet, ways to make your ENEMY sail into the wind!



==============================================================================
                            Things You Should Know
==============================================================================


   Before you enter the walkthrough portion of this document, there are a few 
concepts and items relating to the game that you should understand.  Please 
take the time to read this section; it is short, but important.


 PATCH INFO:  There have been a number of patches since the original game was
 -----------  released.  For those who do not know what a patch does, a patch
              is a program that you install that will correct some of the bugs
              and errors that may exist in a program.  You can certainly play
              Sea Dogs without a patch, but some of the bugs are extremely
              aggravating.  In order to obtain the latest patch, you need only
              a connection to the Internet.  The latest patch is Version 1.06.
              This walkthrough was written with Patch 1.06 installed.  If you
              do not have the latest patch installed, you may not be able to
              follow this walkthrough completely.  To download the latest
              patch, go to:

                 http://www.bethsoft.com/downloads/patches/sd_patch106_eng.zip

              This is the official Sea Dogs website.  You will automatically
              receive a download message.  You can also go to:

                 http://seadogs.bethsoft.com/main.html

              From this page, click on "News" and then find the "Patch Page"
              link.  The size of the patch is 1.29MB.


 LETTER OF MARQUE:  The Letter of Marque is an item that allows you to take on
 -----------------  quests from a number of people.  You will need a Letter of
                    Marque in order to perform tasks from a governor.
                    Obtaining a Letter of Marque makes that nation Loyal to
                    you.  It is possible to switch Letters of Marque (LOM's)
                    several times throughout the course of the game.  However,
                    if in the event you are made a part of the nobility, (you
                    will receive a new wardrobe) you will be unable to change
                    your allegiance.


 NATIONALITY:  Unlike other games, you do not initially choose which nation
 ------------  you wish to serve.  You may choose this during the course of 
               the game.  You may also change your mind and serve someone 
               else.


 QUESTS:  I have divided up the quests and tasks into two categories:
 -------  Essential Quests and Optional Quests.  The Essential Quests are the
          Quests given to you by the governor of the nation you serve.  These 
          Quests progress the storyline.  In the Table of Contents, they are
          denoted with Roman Numerals (I, II, III...).  Optional Quests are
          given to you by various other people.  They usually give you a 
          reward of gold, experience, or reputation.  In the Table of 
          Contents, they are denoted with lower-case letters (a, b, c...). 
          Under each nationality are its Essential and Optional Quests.  Be 
          aware of the fact that you can switch loyalties during the course of
          the game.  Thus, it is possible to perform the Optional and even
          some of the Essential Quests for more than one nation.  Once you are 
          promoted to an Admiral, however, you can no longer change your 
          allegiance at will.  I have marked when you become an Admiral in the
          Table of Contents for each of the 3 European Nations.  For purposes 
          of writing this walkthrough, the Quests are divided up according to
          the nationality that they most logically belong to.  See the Table 
          of Contents above for the Quest names.  Note that these names are my 
          own; the game does not name these Quests.  You will not necessarily 
          finish one quest before beginning another one.

          There are two Quests which I consider extremely beneficial to all 
          four of the Campaigns.  As a result, I have placed them as Essential 
          Quests under all 4 Campaigns.  The Quests are: Adriano Montefi's 
          Spyglass, and Pablo Loco & the Herb.  The Optional Quests do not 
          have their own section, but they are each addressed within the 
          walkthrough.


 TURBO BUTTON:  This is one of the most important controls in the game.  As
 -------------  you sail, you will notice that you move VERY slowly.  If you 
                hold down the Turbo Button, (it is "R" by default) you will 
                move much faster.  You will be using the Turbo Button quite 
                frequently while sailing.  Consider it your accelerator.


 SPELLING:  There are a surprising amount of spelling errors in Sea Dogs.
 ---------  I have left the spelling of names and other words the same as they
            are in the game.


 ABBREVIATIONS:  There are a few abbreviations that I will use frequently
 --------------  throughout this walkthrough.  To many people, they will be
                 self-explanatory.  Nevertheless, here they are:

                    gp - Gold Pieces
                    xp - Experience Points
                    rep - Reputation Points
                    LOM - Letter of Marque
                    Jolly Roger - Pirate Flag


 LANGUAGES:  The creators of Sea Dogs have made the game more entertaining by
 ----------  using some words from other languages.  Depending on which nation
             owns a town, the names of the buildings may be different.  So 
             note the following:

       English: Tavern        English: Store         English: Shipyard
       Pirate: Tavern         Pirate: Store          Pirate: Shipyard
       Spanish: Taberna       Spanish: Almacn       Spanish: Astellero
       French: Taverne        French: Magasin        French: Chantier Naval



==============================================================================
                               ENGLISH CAMPAIGN
==============================================================================


------------
  Highrock
------------

   You will begin in the town of Highrock regardless of which nation you wish
to serve.  You will also be able to gain some easy experience points just from
talking to people in the town.  You only need 3,000xp to move on to Rank 11,
and you can get 1,500xp just from doing quests in this town.  Don't forget
that you start the game with Skill Points.



==============================================================================
I.   Correspondence to Tendales
==============================================================================


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to the guards at the town gate.  One of them would like some wine.
You will run into many people on the streets of Highrock  Be sure to talk with
Theodore and the Old Gunner.  They will teach you about game play basics, and
more importantly, you will receive 250xp for listening to each one.  Now head
off to the Tavern to find some wine.


 Tavern
 ------

   There are several more interesting characters to talk with in the Tavern.  
You can hire Julius Ironcast as a Master Gunner, if you can afford his desired
wages.  You should also talk to the Fencer and Sailor.  They will teach you
more gameplay basics, and you will receive ANOTHER 250xp for each of them.  Be
sure to talk with Roberto Gorrando.  Tell him that you are a pirate, not a
merchant. He will tell you about a man named Adriano Montefi, who makes
wonderful Spyglasses.

     NOTE: If you do not talk to Gorrando in the Tavern, you will not be able
           to find Montefi later.

   Head over to the Tavern owner and talk business with him.  You will have to
pay 1gp for some wine, but it is worth every penny.  Now return to the guard.


 Streets
 -------

   Give the wine to the guard.  You will receive 250xp and +1 rep.  Talk with
the other guard, and he will reveal that he has a craving for...Rum.  Time to
go back to the Tavern.  On your way back, look for a man named Albrecht
Zalpher.  Talk to him, and he will hint at a new invention that he has.  DO
NOT ask about it.  Instead, suggest that he could work aboard your ship as a
Carpenter in order to escape Highrock.  He will agree and will join your ship.


 Tavern
 ------

   Once again, talk with the Tavern owner.  Follow the same conversation
string at before with the wine, and this time you will be able to obtain some
Rum.  Now return to the guard outside.


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to the guard who wanted the Rum.  You will receive 250xp and +2 rep.
At this point, you should have 1,500xp.  Now, head to the Townhall (it is the
largest building in the town).


 Townhall
 --------

   Inside, talk with Samuel Mortons.  Ask him for a Letter of Marque.  After
receiving it, ask him if he has any tasks for you.  He will send you to
Tendales to deliver a letter to the governor there.



==============================================================================
II.   Saving Dead Island
==============================================================================


-------------
  Tendales
-------------

   Once you arrive in Tendales, Albrecht Zalpfer will leave your ship.  You no
longer have a Carpenter, but you do receive 100xp.  Find Zalpfer on the
Streets and talk to him.  He will give you some Sketches for a new ship.


 Shipyard
 --------

   You can sell the Sketches you just received from Zalpfer here.  You will
receive 1,500gp.  When you are done here, head to the Townhall.


 Townhall
 --------

   Give the Letter to John Clifford Brin.  You will receive 500xp, 500gp,
and +2 rep.  He will then give you another quest.  The people of Dead Island
are starving, and he wants you to deliver a shipment of Wheat there.  Now head 
to the Tavern.

   In this Tavern, there are two men who are looking for work.  One of them is
Andrew Shoo, who will become your Boatswain if you hire him.  The other one is 
Adam Mullen, a Master Purser.  There is nothing else to do here at the present
time.  Head now to Dead Island.

wheat to.  Congratulations, you have saved Dead Island from starvation!  Also, 
you can talk with David Murray here.  He will tell you a story of a battle at 
sea gone horribly wrong.  It seems that the Frigate he was serving on was in 
poor condition.  Hmmm.  You can hire him as a Master Gunner if you want.  
There is a Jacon Ashton in the Tavern as well, but don't talk to him just yet.
Now leave the Tavern.

him for 100gp each.  Each indulgence gives you +1 rep.  Now head to the Store.

cwt of Linen to Christopher Offut at Tendales.  Note that your starting ship
only holds 400cwt.  If you want to do this quest, sell off all your cannon 
shot, and then accept his quest.  Save your game, in case you are attacked by 
enemies while at sea.  Now return to Tendales.

feeling better.  You will receive 250xp and learn that Ropeflake can be found
in the harbor at El Caimano.  Before attempting to fight the pirate, you
should sail with Jacon Ashton to Itkal.

           Be prepared!


--------------
  El Caimano

   When you arrive in the harbor, you will be set upon by Ropeflake.  You can

win.  When you defeat him, return to Tendales.

FREE!!!  There is also a Stranger roaming the streets.  Talk to him and he
will send you to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island

   Find Pablo Loco on the streets.  He will give you the herb that you seek,
but you must help him first.  Pablo needs some Tezhkataly wood.  This wood can
only be found in one place - Dead Island.

     NOTE: Your Reputation must be at least "Good Matey" or Pablo will not
           trust you, and you won't be able to get the quest.

   You will also encounter Raymond Ibelin on the streets.  You can hire him if
you want (and you will want to).  He is a First Mate.

     NOTE: Raymond Ibelin may not appear on Shark Island if you are not using

- Gray Sails.



==============================================================================
VII.   Adriano Montefi's Spyglass
==============================================================================

   Note that the quest for Montefi's Spyglass is Optional.  If you do not wish
to do it, skip ahead to section VIII.  If you decide to get the Spyglass, you
are going to take two major Reputation hits, since you have to change your LOM
twice.  To prepare for this, you might want to sail to Dead Island and buy at
least 20 indulgences.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Tavern
 ------

   There are two men in the Tavern that you may hire, if you wish.  Dreyfus
the Fuse is a Master Gunner, and quite possibly the single best Officer in the
game.  He is also the most expensive.  You can also hire Jaque Dullarse as a
Carpenter, if you need one.

   At one of the tables is a Spanish Agent.  Talk to him and he will offer you
the opportunity to make restitution with Spain.  But it is not cheap!  It will
cost you 5,000gp and -10 rep.  You must do it in order to gain entry into
Spanish towns.  Once you are done, sail to El Caimano.


--------------
  El Caimano

Sails.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk to the English Agent.  You will be given the option of buying back
your English LOM.  You must pay another 5,000gp and lose -10 rep more.  You
now need to search for Peter Ordo.  He is located on Tel-Kerrat, a French
island in the east.



==============================================================================
VIII.   The Plot
==============================================================================


--------------
  Tel-Kerrat
--------------


 Store
 -----

   Talk to Eustache Heumont, the store owner.  Ask him about a stranger who
used to live in Tel-Kerrat.  Now leave the store.


 Streets
 -------

   You will see a new person on the streets.  He is wearing a yellow bandanna.
It is Peter Ordo!  If you talk to him, he will reveal that Beltrop is planning
on attacking Tendales, and that he has some help, courtesy of an Englishman.
Ordo also has a favor to request of you.  He wants you to rescue his girl,
Alicia, from Gray Sails.  In return for this, he will accompany you to
Tendales to help defend it.

  Gray Sails
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   You will find Alicia out on the streets.  Talk to her and she will ask you

   Talk to Peter Ordo.  According to a letter that Alicia managed to smuggle 
out of Gray Sails, the insider that is helping the pirates is... Samuel 
Mortons!!  You will receive 1,000xp and +3 rep.  You should make your way to 
Tendales, but stop by Dead Island first if you have not recovered from the 
pair of -10 rep penalties which resulted from switching your LOM's twice.



==============================================================================
IX.   Confronting the Traitor
==============================================================================


------------
  Tendales
------------


 Townhall

   Talk to John Clifford Brin.  Show him the letter that Alicia found.  You

   Gritstone will give you another big mission.  You are to attack and capture 
Costa Sinistra!  He will also give you 4,000gp at this time.


------------------
  Costa Sinistra
------------------

   When attacking a city, you will be faced with strong walls that have many 
cannons.  First of all, you must take out the cannons.  Each cannon that you
destroy will earn you 1,000xp.  If you can take out all of the cannons, you
will receive 20,000xp.  You now have the option of assaulting the town.  When
you do this, you will be met by the town guard.  Typically, it is a force of
between 500 and 999 men.  Use you fencing skills to defeat them.

   After you succeed in defeating the guard, you will enter the town.  You
will encounter an Honorable Citizen.  This person represents the general
populace.  Talk to him and you will have two options:

      1. Loot the city.  You request 10,000gp before you will leave.
      2. Claim the island for England.

   Obviously, you came to capture the island for England, so choose that
option.  You will receive 5,000xp and +5 rep.

   Now return to Alexander Gritstone at Highrock.



==============================================================================
XI.   The French Cannons
==============================================================================


------------
  Highrock
------------


 Townhall
 --------

   You return to inform Gritstone of your success.  He will give you a title.  
You are now a Baron!  You will receive a shiny new wardrobe.  However, you are 
now committed to the English cause.  Gritstone has another assignment for you.  
You are to search for some French cannons that are capable of dealing 
horrendous amounts of punishment.


---------------
  Dead Island
---------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk to Laurence Norton.  He will tell you a tale of a French ship that was
firing 48 pound cannons!!  Learning this earns you 100xp.  These are the super 
cannons you are to look for.  Norton tells you that he was near Omory when his 
story unfolded.  Perhaps you should visit there as well.


---------
  Omory
---------

   First of all, take out the cannons.  Each cannon that you destroy will earn
you 1,000xp.  If you can take out all of the cannons, you will receive
20,000xp.  You now have the option of assaulting the town.  When you do this,
you will be met by the town guard.  Typically, it is a force of between 500
and 999 men.  Use you fencing skills to defeat them.

   After you succeed in defeating the guard, you will enter the town.  You

                   -- ENDING MOVIE FOR ENGLISH CAMPAIGN --

   The game is not over yet.  Try playing through one of the other Campaigns.
The French, Spanish, and Pirates are waiting...





==============================================================================
                               SPANISH CAMPAIGN
==============================================================================


   As is true with the English, (and every Campaign) you begin your adventure
in Highrock.  You are free to do as few or as many of the English quests as
you want.  However, do NOT talk to Samuel Mortons and get a LOM.  One quest
that you probably should do is the Pablo Loco & The Herb quest, as this gives
you Dick Oakenwood (chortle, chortle) who serves as your Surgeon for free!!

   In the Preparation section below, I will include all the quests that you
can perform in Highrock at the beginning of the game.  I will then set the
stage for obtaining your Spanish LOM.  I will not include many of the Optional
English Quests.  See the English Campaign walkthrough for more information
regarding these Quests.



==============================================================================
I.   Preparations
==============================================================================


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to the guards at the town gate.  One of them would like some wine.
You will run into many people on the streets of Highrock  Be sure to talk with
Theodore and the Old Gunner.  They will teach you about game play basics, and
more importantly, you will receive 250xp for listening to each one.  Now head
off to the Tavern to find some wine.


 Tavern
 ------

   There are several more interesting characters to talk with in the Tavern.
You can hire Julius Ironcast as a Master Gunner, if you can afford his desired
wages.  You should also talk to the Fencer and Sailor.  They will teach you
more gameplay basics, and you will receive ANOTHER 250xp for each of them.  Be
sure to talk with Roberto Gorrando.  Tell him that you are a pirate, not a
merchant. He will tell you about a man named Adriano Montefi, who makes
wonderful Spyglasses.

     NOTE: If you do not talk to Gorrando in the Tavern, you will not be able
           to find Montefi later.

   Head over to the Tavern owner and talk business with him.  You will have to
pay 1gp for some wine, but it is worth every penny.  Now return to the guard.


 Streets
 -------

   Give the wine to the guard.  You will receive 250xp and +1 rep.  Talk with
the other guard, and he will reveal that he has a craving for...Rum.  Time to
go back to the Tavern.  On your way back, look for a man named Albrecht
Zalpher.  Talk to him, and he will hint at a new invention that he has.  DO
NOT ask about it.  Instead, suggest that he could work aboard your ship as a
Carpenter in order to escape Highrock.  He will agree and will join your ship.


 Tavern
 ------

   Once again, talk with the Tavern owner.  Follow the same conversation
string aS before with the wine, and this time you will be able to obtain some
Rum.  Now return to the guard outside.


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to the guard who wanted the Rum.  You will receive 250xp and +2 rep.
At this point, you should have 1,500xp.  Now, head to the Tendales.


-------------
  Tendales
-------------

   Once you arrive in Tendales, Albrecht Zalpfer will leave your ship.  You no
longer have a Carpenter, but you do receive 100xp.  Find Zalpfer on the
Streets and talk to him.  He will give you some Sketches for a new ship.

   At this point, there is nothing preventing you from sailing out to Gray
Sails and beginning your career as a Spanish Privateer.  However, in order to
afford your Spanish LOM, you will need at least 5,000gp.  You will not suffer 
a Reputation loss since you do not have a LOM yet.  However, it might also be 
a good idea to stop by Dead Island and buy lots of indulgences from the 
Priest.  Once you ally with the Spanish, the English are going to hate you,
and you will not be able to enter English ports.

   If you want to get Dick Oakenwood, the free Surgeon, continue on.  If you 
would rather just get your Spanish LOM and move on, skip to section III.

      If you want to get the free Surgeon, sail to Highrock.
      If you want to skip it and get your LOM, sail to Gray Sails.



==============================================================================
II.   Pablo Loco & The Herb
==============================================================================


------------
  Highrock
------------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Doctor Alumnus.  You might have to talk to him two or three times.
He will ask you to find an herb for him.  He won't be able to pay you in gold,
but he will assign one of his students to work as a Surgeon on your ship - for
FREE!!!  There is also a Stranger roaming the streets.  Talk to him and he
will send you to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Streets
 -------

   Find Pablo Loco on the streets.  He will give you the herb that you seek,
but you must help him first.  Pablo needs some Tezhkataly wood.  This wood can
only be found in one place - Dead Island.

     NOTE: Your Reputation must be at least "Good Matey" or Pablo will not
           trust you, and you won't be able to get the quest.

   You will also encounter Raymond Ibelin on the streets.  You can hire him if
you want (and you will want to).  He is a First Mate.

     NOTE: Raymond Ibelin may not appear on Shark Island if you are not using
           the most recent patch.  If he is not here, you can find him on Isle
           d'Orange.


---------------
  Dead Island
---------------


 Store
 -----

   Talk to Nigel Fester.  Tell him you would like to buy some Tezhkataly wood.
He has some and is willing to sell it to you, but it will cost you 1,500gp.
Buy it, and return to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Streets
 -------

   Give the wood to Pablo Loco.  Not only will you receive the herb, you will
also get 500xp.  Now head back to Doctor Alumnus on Highrock.

   Talk to Doctor Alumnus.  You will give him the herb, and he will tell you

==============================================================================
III.   Working for Spain
==============================================================================


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Tavern
 ------

   There are two men in the Tavern that you may hire, if you wish.  Dreyfus
the Fuse is a Master Gunner, and quite possibly the single best Officer in the
game.  He is also the most expensive.  You can also hire Jaque Dullarse as a
Carpenter, if you need one.

   At one of the tables is a Spanish Agent.  Talk to him and he will offer you
the opportunity to make restitution with Spain.  But it is not cheap!  It will
cost you 5,000gp.  You must do it in order to gain entry into Spanish towns,
and also to get your Spanish LOM.  Once you are done, sail to Granda Avilia.

     NOTE: If you are short on cash, and you have a First Mate, (most likely
           Raymond Ibelin on Shark Island) do the following:  Sail around in
	   the harbor of Shark Island.  You can fight the Pirate ships in the
	   harbor without any loss of Reputation.  Board one of them, take it
	   as a Prize Ship, and sail back to town.  Sell the Prize Ship for a
	   lot of gold.  Repeat the process.  If you enter the harbor and
	   there are no ships there to fight, simply enter the town and then
	   return to the Open Sea.  This will save you money because you only
	   pay your crew when you sail on the world map.

  Granda Avilia

Muntral will pay you when you deliver the letter to him.

   Deliver the letter to de Muntral.  You will receive 1,00gp, 500xp, and +1
rep.  Now you should head to the Taberna.


 Taberna
 -------

   The owner of the Taberna, Arnau Manlleu, tell you that his brother went
missing at sea.  Pirates are suspected to be the cause.  He says that the 
alcalde (governor) at Granda Avilia can tell you more.


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Catalina in the Streets.  She is waiting for her Carlos, who is
missing.  He was on the "El Lobo".  Offer to help her.

   Talk to Bartholomew Olster.  He says that he is looking for Carla.


 Taberna
 -------

   Inside is Carla.  Talk to her, and she will tell you that she is busy.  Hm.
When you leave the Taberna and look for Olster, he is nowhere to be found.


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk to de Muntral, and he will tell you that his assistant, Bartholomew 
Olster, was killed.  He sends you off to bring Carla in.


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Jaime Zingermann.  He says that Carla is a witch.  Ask him where
you can find her.  He will direct you back to the Taberna.


 Taberna
 -------

   Talk to the Tavern owner.  He will tell you that Carla sailed away with a
Miguel Qenda.  They sailed off to one of the small Spanish islands.  Try El
Caimano.


--------------
  El Caimano
--------------


 Taberna
 -------

   Talk with Victor Martos.  He will tell you about his old ship.  It turns
out that he sailed with the Captain who was last seen with Carla.  He tells
you that Carla could be back at Granda Avilia.  You can also hire Martos if
you want.  He is a Boatswain.  Time to return to Granda Avilia.


-----------------
  Granda Avilia
-----------------


 Taberna
 -------

   Carla is in here!  There are a couple of different ways you can resolve the
situation.  You can:

      1. You can "bear witness" against her.  Then leave the Taberna, and talk
         to the Inquisitor on the streets.  Tell him that Carla is in the 
         Taberna.  You will get to see a short movie where she is burned at 
         the stake.
      2. Choose the other option, and Carla will tell you her side of the 
         story.  You can then choose to let her go.  This yields 5,000xp.


----------------
  Isla Ballena
----------------


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk to de Muntral.  Ask him about the voyage that the two ships attempted
to make.  When he asks why you want to know, tell him you are looking for a
challenge.  You will be sent to solve the mystery of the disappearances.


-------------
  Inachetla
-------------

   When you arrive here, you will be attacked by "El Lobo."  Defeat the ship.
There might be some survivors.  Remember what the Taberna owner mentioned
about Pirates sometimes dealing in slaves?  First, return to Granda Avilia.


-----------------
  Granda Avilia
-----------------


 Taberna
 -------

   Talk to Padre Ignacio.  He would like to go to Skullshores.  Conveniently,
that is where you should be heading as well!  You will receive +1 rep for
agreeing to bring him with.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   Look for Padre Ignacio on the streets.  Apparently, he wants to go to Shark
Island instead.


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with the Tavern owner.  Ask him about slaves, and he will tell you the 
slave dealer's name: Raymundo.


 Streets
 -------

   Look for Raymundo the Meatman, who is out on the streets.  Talk to him and
you will learn that Carlos escaped from the Pirates.  The island of Omory 
opens up on your map now.  First, though, head to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------

   You will receive 500xp and +5 rep for bringing Padre Ignacio to Shark 
Island.  Now head to the Tavern.


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with Hugo Lumbermill.  He will tell you his story.  He offers you
1,000gp to sail to a Spanish city for him and bring him back a Spanish LOM.  
There are only two possible cities to choose from, since only two of them have
alcaldes.  Head to Granda Avilia, since it is closer.


-----------------
  Granda Avilia
-----------------


  Townhall
  --------

    Tell de Mercadal about Hugo Lumbermill's request.  de Mercadal is not too
pleased to hear this.  Hmm.  Perhaps it is time to try at Isla Ballena.


----------------
  Isla Ballena
----------------


 Townhall
 --------

   Guilabertus de Muntral is more open to you your idea of giving Lumbermill a
Spanish LOM.  You have a couple of options here:

      1. Betrayal - You can set Lumbermill up.  Sail back to Shark Island and
         give Lumbermill the Spanish LOM.  He will pay you your 1,000gp.  When
         he sails for Spain, they will arrest him.  You will lose -15 rep, but
         de Muntral will pay you 2,500gp for the deed.
      2. Argue Lumbermill's Case - Convince the alcalde to give Lumbermill a
         LOM.  Return to Shark Island with it and give it to Lumbermill for
         1,000gp and +5 rep.

   Now it is time to continue searching for Carlos.  On to Omory!


---------
  Omory
---------


 Taverne
 -------

   When you enter, you will find Carlos here!  Talk to him and you will
receive 1,000xp.  He would like you to return to Catalina at Isla Ballena and 
tell her what has happened with him.

 -------

   Find Catalina on the Streets and tell her about Carlos.  You will receive
+5 rep.


 Townhall

are any new quests.

  Granda Avilia
-----------------

   When you arrive, you will encounter the Shnyava "Mercury".  when you defeat 
the enemy ship, you will receive 1,000xp and +1 rep.  Return now to Granda 
Avilia.


-----------------
  Granda Avilia
-----------------


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk with de Mercadal and tell him that you sank the pirate.  He will tell 
you that you must have sunk the wrong pirate ship, because the real Francois 
is attacking El Caimano!


--------------
  El Caimano
--------------

   You set sail for El Caimano, expecting to be attacked in the harbor.  
However, no attack materializes.  Hmmm.  Odd.  At any rate, enter the town.


 Taberna
 -------

   Talk to the Stranger With A French Accent.  He will sell you information
regarding Francois for 1,000gp.  As it turns out, Olaf has been hiding the 
pirate all along!  Better sail back to Shark Island quickly!


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Confront Olaf Ulsson.  As the heated conversation progresses, you begin to 
feel very, very, VERY...stupid.  It seems that you have been tricked.  Who 
would have thought that the Stranger With A French Accent was really Francois?  
It is time to return to Aliando and settle this once and for all!


-----------
  Aliando
-----------

   When you arrive, you will finally be fighting the REAL Francois.  If you 
defeat him, you will receive 3,000gp and +3 rep.  Now it is time to collect 
the long overdue reward.  Sail back to Granda Avilia.

   Find and talk to Theodoro Alameda.  He is looking for someone to escort him 
safely to Costa Sinistra.  Accept his offer.


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk to de Mercadal.  When you tell him that you have finally dealt with
the pirate, you will receive 5,000gp.  He also has a new task for you.  He
would like you to meet a Spanish agent located at Gray Sails.  First, stop by 
Costa Sinistra.


------------------
  Costa Sinistra
------------------

   When you arrive in Costa Sinistra, Alameda will leave you.  Find him and 
talk to him in order to receive your reward:  2,000gp, 1,000xp, and +1 rep.  
Now continue on to Gray Sails.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Jose Maria Lopezm who is on the streets.  He wants you to tell

   Guilabertus de Muntral will tell you that there are no ships available to
defend the island.  Which really means no ships except yours!  He offers to
hire you for 3,000gp.  Accepting this offer will also net you 500xp and 
+3 rep.

you can win the battle, you will receive 3,000xp, and +3 rep.

   Talk with de Muntral.  He will give you 3,000gp and send you on your way to 
Granda Avilia.  Apparently, the other alcalde needs your help as well.  Before 
you leave, though, head to the Taberna.


 Taberna
 -------

   Who says that doing good does not pay?  You will find your old friend Hugo 
Lumbermill in here.  Talk to him, and he will reveal some interesting news.  
It seems that a French Man O' War is trying to repair itself at Chaktcha.  
Apparently, the crew is only half of its usual 800 men.  Since the Man O' War 
is THE most powerful type of ship, it might help you to go and capture it.


------------
  Chaktcha
------------

   The Man O' War here is "weak" - meaning that it is a fair fight!  Try your
hardest to board it so you can claim your very own Man O' War.  If and when 
you win, continue on to Granda Avilia.



==============================================================================
X.   Capturing Dead Island
==============================================================================

  Granda Avilia

populace.  Talk to him and you will have two options:

      1. Loot the city.  You request 10,000gp before you will leave.
      2. Claim the island in the name of Spain.

   Obviously, you came to capture the island, so choose that option.  You will

attack a Spanish colony!  First, you must discover which one.


 Taberna
 -------

   Talk with the owner.  He will tell you that his brother is marooned at El

investigate.

   Talk with Roberto Engano.  He will give you the information that you need.
You will also receive 1,000xp.  Back to Granda Avilia!


-----------------
  Granda Avilia
-----------------


 Townhall
 --------

   Give the papers to de Mercadal.  You should then suggest a pre-emptive
attack on the French fleet at Tel-Kerrat.  Head there as soon as you are 
ready - but be ready for a fight!


--------------
  Tel-Kerrat
--------------

   Well, if you have been hoping for a battle, this is sure to please!  You 
will be facing the following 3 powerful ships:

      The Man O' War "Foch" (Class 1)
      The French Warship "Provence" (Class 2)
      The Shnyava "Le Triomphant" (Class 4)

   If you did not take the opportunity to capture a Man O' War earlier on, now

                   -- ENDING MOVIE FOR SPANISH CAMPAIGN --

   The game is not over yet.  Try playing through one of the other Campaigns.
The English, French, and Pirates are waiting...





==============================================================================
                               FRENCH CAMPAIGN
==============================================================================


   As is true with the English, (and every Campaign) you begin your adventure
in Highrock.  You are free to do as few or as many of the English quests as
you want.  However, do NOT talk to Samuel Mortons and get a LOM.  One quest
that you probably should do is the Pablo Loco & The Herb quest, as this gives
you Dick Oakenwood (chortle, chortle) who serves as your Surgeon for free!!

   In the Preparation section below, I will include all the quests that you
can perform in Highrock at the beginning of the game.  I will then set the
stage for obtaining your French LOM.  I will not include many of the Optional
English Quests.  See the English Campaign walkthrough for more information
regarding these Quests.



==============================================================================
I.   Preparations
==============================================================================


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to the guards at the town gate.  One of them would like some wine.
You will run into many people on the streets of Highrock  Be sure to talk with
Theodore and the Old Gunner.  They will teach you about game play basics, and
more importantly, you will receive 250xp for listening to each one.  Now head
off to the Tavern to find some wine.


 Tavern
 ------

   There are several more interesting characters to talk with in the Tavern.
You can hire Julius Ironcast as a Master Gunner, if you can afford his desired
wages.  You should also talk to the Fencer and Sailor.  They will teach you
more gameplay basics, and you will receive ANOTHER 250xp for each of them.  Be
sure to talk with Roberto Gorrando.  Tell him that you are a pirate, not a
merchant. He will tell you about a man named Adriano Montefi, who makes
wonderful Spyglasses.

     NOTE: If you do not talk to Gorrando in the Tavern, you will not be able
           to find Montefi later.

   Head over to the Tavern owner and talk business with him.  You will have to
pay 1gp for some wine, but it is worth every penny.  Now return to the guard.


 Streets
 -------

   Give the wine to the guard.  You will receive 250xp and +1 rep.  Talk with
the other guard, and he will reveal that he has a craving for...Rum.  Time to
go back to the Tavern.  On your way back, look for a man named Albrecht
Zalpher.  Talk to him, and he will hint at a new invention that he has.  DO
NOT ask about it.  Instead, suggest that he could work aboard your ship as a
Carpenter in order to escape Highrock.  He will agree and will join your ship.


 Tavern
 ------

   Once again, talk with the Tavern owner.  Follow the same conversation
string aS before with the wine, and this time you will be able to obtain some
Rum.  Now return to the guard outside.


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to the guard who wanted the Rum.  You will receive 250xp and +2 rep.
At this point, you should have 1,500xp.  Now, head to the Tendales.


-------------
  Tendales
-------------

   Once you arrive in Tendales, Albrecht Zalpfer will leave your ship.  You no
longer have a Carpenter, but you do receive 100xp.  Find Zalpfer on the
Streets and talk to him.  He will give you some Sketches for a new ship.

   At this point, there is nothing preventing you from sailing out to Belflor
and beginning your career as a French Privateer.  However, you might want to
spend some time completing the easy English Quests in order to gain strength.
You might also want to stop by Dead Island and buy lots of indulgences from
the Priest (at least 20).

   If you want to get Dick Oakenwood, the free Surgeon, continue on.  If you
would rather just get your French LOM and move on, skip to section III.

      If you want to get the free Surgeon, sail to Highrock.
      If you want to skip it and get your LOM, sail to Belflor.



==============================================================================
II.   Pablo Loco & The Herb
==============================================================================


------------
  Highrock
------------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Doctor Alumnus.  You might have to talk to him two or three times.
He will ask you to find an herb for him.  He won't be able to pay you in gold,
but he will assign one of his students to work as a Surgeon on your ship - for
FREE!!!  There is also a Stranger roaming the streets.  Talk to him and he
will send you to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Streets
 -------

   Find Pablo Loco on the streets.  He will give you the herb that you seek,
but you must help him first.  Pablo needs some Tezhkataly wood.  This wood can
only be found in one place - Dead Island.

     NOTE: Your Reputation must be at least "Good Matey" or Pablo will not
           trust you, and you won't be able to get the quest.

   You will also encounter Raymond Ibelin on the streets.  You can hire him if
you want (and you will want to).  He is a First Mate.

     NOTE: Raymond Ibelin may not appear on Shark Island if you are not using
           the most recent patch.  If he is not here, you can find him on Isle
           d'Orange.


---------------
  Dead Island
---------------


 Store
 -----

   Talk to Nigel Fester.  Tell him you would like to buy some Tezhkataly wood.
He has some and is willing to sell it to you, but it will cost you 1,500gp.
Buy it, and return to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Streets
 -------

   Give the wood to Pablo Loco.  Not only will you receive the herb, you will
also get 500xp.  Now head back to Doctor Alumnus on Highrock.


------------
  Highrock
------------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Doctor Alumnus.  You will give him the herb, and he will tell you
that your new Surgeon is in the Tavern.


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk to Dick Oakenwood (hee, hee).  He will join your crew as a Surgeon who
will work for free!!!   Now sail to Belflor.



==============================================================================
III.   Meeting With de Bijou
==============================================================================


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk with Francois de Bijou.  You can ask him for your Letter of Marque,
and he will give one to you.  He will also give you your first task.  You are 
to travel to Gray Sails and meet with a French agent there.  He will send you 
back to Belflor with a letter.


 Street
 ------

   Just outside of the Townhall, a guard will remark on how he would love to 
marry the governor's daughter.  Hmmm.

   If you are looking for a Boatswain, you can talk with Gavrila Dubinin.
Also on the Streets is Maugis Saubruic, who wants an escort to Omory.  He pays 
well, so you should accept his request.  You will also encounter a Tavern Girl 
who is waiting for her fiance, George Marlot, who was aboard the "Mercurio."

   Finally, you may also run across Andreas Fickler.  He is a Purser who fears
that his Captain will try to kill him at any moment.  Agree to try and help 
him.


 Taverne
 -------

   You can hire Beuve Hainault as a Surgeon, if you are in need of one.
However, if you got Dick Oakenwood to serve on your ship, you do not need a 
Surgeon.

   You will also find Victor Bretier here.  He is the Captain whom Fickler
fears so much.  He mourns the loss of his cargo.  The cargo was worth 500gp.  
You can pay this if you wish.  If you do, return to the Streets and talk with 
Fickler again.  He will offer to join you as a Master Purser.  It is now time
to head to Gray Sails, but you should head to Omory first if you accepted
Saubruic's Quest.


---------
  Omory
---------


 Streets
 -------

   You will receive 500xp and +3 rep for escorting Maugis Saubruic to Omory.  
Be sure to find him on the Streets and talk to him in order to receive your 
payment of 1,000gp.  Now on to Gray Sails!



==============================================================================
IV.   August Bromont
==============================================================================


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   You will find August Bromont on the Streets.  Talking to him will earn you
500xp and Bromont's Note.  You should now head back to Belflor with the Note.



==============================================================================

==============================================================================


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk to de Bijou.  Give him the Note and you will receive 1,500gp and +1
rep.  He will now send you to meet the Master of the Merchant Guild, who is on
Isle d'Orange.  You will also be introduced to de Bijou's daughter.


-----------------
  Isle d'Orange
-----------------


 Streets
 -------

   You will find Aurelien Dupre, the Merchant Master, in the Streets.  Talk
with him in order to receive the promissory note, which ends up being a
20,000gp loan to de Bijou.

   On the Streets, you will encounter an Old Woman who is searching for a very 
special ring.  Keep an eye open for it.


 Taverne
 -------

   Talk with Artois de Moulette.  It seems that he has had a run of bad luck
recently, and has been unable to find employment.  Agree to take up his case
with the governor of this island.  Also, talk to the Taverne owner, and her 
will tell you the story of the Old Woman and the Ring.


 Townhall
 --------

   Nicolas de Monferrat is the governor of Isle d'Orange.  Try and persuade
Monferrat to help de Moulette.  You will fail at your attempt, but you will
receive 250xp for the effort.  Return to the Taverne.


 Taverne
 -------

   Talk to de Moulette again.  You will tell him that you were unable to plead
his case successfully to the governor, but you will take him on as a First
Mate.  This is the better of the 2 First Mates in the game!  Now, on to
Belflor.



==============================================================================
VI.   The Ransom
==============================================================================


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk with de Bijou.  Give him the loan note, and you will receive 2,500gp 
and +2 rep.  It turns out that the loan was meant to pay the Ransom for a good 
friend of the governor's.  He would like you to deliver the Ransom to Gray 
Sails and bring back his friend.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Townhall (gutted out ship)
 --------------------------

   Talk to Desmond Beltrop.  Tell him that Bijou is willing to pay the ransom.
Beltrop does not like the terms of the offer, and refuses to comply.  You need 
to bring this development back to de Bijou.

   While you are in Gray Sails, you can set out to obtain yourself a better 
Spyglass, if you want.

      If you want to get the Spyglass now, head to the Tavern.
      If you want to deliver the letter now, sail to Belflor.



==============================================================================
VII.   Adriano Montefi's Spyglass
==============================================================================

   Note that the quest for Montefi's Spyglass is Optional.  If you do not wish
to do it, skip ahead to section VIII.  If you decide to get the Spyglass,
check to see your relations with Spain (Press F1 and look at your Logbook).
If they are hostile toward you, then you will have to take two major
Reputation hits, since you will have to change your LOM twice.  To prepare for
this, you might want to sail to Dead Island and buy at least 20 indulgences.
Or perhaps you took my advice and did this earlier.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Tavern
 ------

   There are two men in the Tavern that you may hire, if you wish.  Dreyfus
the Fuse is a Master Gunner, and quite possibly the single best Officer in the
game.  He is also the most expensive.  You can also hire Jaque Dullarse as a
Carpenter, if you need one.

   At one of the tables is a Spanish Agent.  If your Reputation with Spain is 
Hostile, you should talk to him.  He will offer you the opportunity to make 
restitution with Spain.  But it is not cheap!  It will cost you 5,000gp and 
-10 rep.  You must do it in order to gain entry into Spanish towns.  Once you 
are done, sail to El Caimano.


--------------
  El Caimano
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Adriano Montefi on the streets.  In order to make you a Spyglass,
he needs you to perform a task for him.  He needs some Crystals, which can be
found at the store on Granda Avilia.


-----------------
  Granda Avilia
-----------------


 Almacn
 -------

   Talk to Lorenzo Avido.  He has the crystals and will give them to you for
500gp.  Now return to Montefi on El Caimano.


--------------
  El Caimano
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Adriano Montefi again.  You will give him the Crystals and he will
give you the Superior Glass (see the section of this document entitled Naval
Warfare for more information about Spyglasses).  You will also receive
1,000xp.  You are now finished with Spanish cities, so head back to Gray
Sails.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk to the French Agent.  You will be given the option of buying back
your French LOM.  You must pay another 5,000gp and lose -10 rep more.  Now 
return to Belflor and tell de Bijou of the failed ransom attempt.



==============================================================================
VIII.   Rescue Plan
==============================================================================


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk with de Bijou.  He is NOT pleased with this latest development.  He 
tells you that you are free to try a different approach in order to release 
his friend.  Head back to Gray Sails and see what you can do.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   Look for Damien Rotnie on the Streets.  His ship has been commandeered by
Beltrop, and he wants you to help him get it back.  His ship is the "Odysseus"
and it is in the harbor.  Note that you MUST board the ship.  DO NOT sink it.
Also, for whatever reason, you must not only board it, you must take it as
your own ship (not a Prize Ship).  When you finish this, head to the Tavern.


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk to Damien Rotnie.  In exchange for having helped him, he has helped
you - by freeing the de Bijou's friend for you!  Now, talk to Thierry la
Moulle (de Bijou's friend).  He is VERY grateful that you rescued him.  Time
to sail back to Belflor!


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Taverne
 -------

   Talk with Thierry la Moulle in the Taverne.  He will give you your reward
for having rescued him - 5,000gp!!  Now sail to Isle d'Orange.



==============================================================================
IX.   The Kidnapping
==============================================================================


-----------------
  Isle d'Orange
-----------------


 Taverne
 -------

   Inside, you will run into an interesting pair of people.  The first one you 
should talk to is Fouqueret Araines.  He wants you to help him kidnap governor
de Bijou's daughter.  Hmmmm.  Say no.  Next, talk to Milon Ancerville.  He
expresses interest in Araines' idea.  This is getting a bit disturbing.
Perhaps you should go and warn de Bijou.


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Townhall
 --------

   Report to de Bijou all that you have learned about these kidnapping rumors.
He will dismiss them as mere threats.  You will receive 1,000xp and +3 rep.


 Taverne
 -------

   Talk with the Taverne owner.  He will tell you that someone has kidnapped
the governor's daughter.  Uh, oh!  Quickly, back to the Townhall!!


 Townhall
 --------

   Offer your help in rescuing de Bijou's daughter.  You should now sail back
to Isle d'Orange.


-----------------
  Isle d'Orange
-----------------


 Taverne
 -------

   Talk with Milton Ancerville.  Interrogate him about the kidnapping.  He
says that Araines hired a Pirate to help him with the plot.  You will receive
500xp for learning this.  On to Gray Sails.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk to Michael Guttenshruge.  You will find out from him that Araines is
at Inachetla.  This earns you 2,000xp.  In order to sneak close enough to 
Araines so that he doesn't run away, you will need to switch ships with
Guttenshruge.  Now sail to Inachetla.


-------------
  Inachetla
-------------

   DO NOT sink the ship!  There is a valuable item on board.  Araines is
sailing the Bark "Nemesis".  The only problem is that it is sailing a French 
flag.  If you fire upon it, you will lose -25 rep, and you will raise the 
Pirate Flag.  Do this anyway.  Board the ship and you will receive 1,000gp,
Ataines's Ring, and the Logbook of the "Nemesis".  Now you can either capture
this ship as your own, or you can just let her sink.  DO NOT take her as a 
Prize Ship.  After deciding upon one of the two options above, you will 
receive +25 rep and your LEtter of Marque.  Yay!  Now, return to Isle d'Orange.
capture the ship.


-----------------
  Isle d'Orange
-----------------


 Taverne
 -------

   Talk with Brantome Tabarie.  Show him the Ring and he tells you that he
will release de Bijou's daughter.  You will receive 3,000xp.  Now return to
Belflor.

==============================================================================


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk with de Bijou.  He is very, very grateful.  You will receive 10,000gp
and +5 rep.  However, there are more problems on the horizon.  Spain is
launching an attack on Belflor, and he wants you to help defend the town.
Agree to his request.


 Harbor
 ------

   In the harbor are three Spanish ships:  The War Galleon "Valencia"
(Class 3), the Frigate "Anaga" (Class 3), and the Corvette "Torrero" (Class
3).  Defeat them, then return to talk with Bijou.


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk with de Bijou.  He is very, very grateful.  You will receive 5,000gp.
He will have no new tasks for you.


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to the Stranger on the Streets.  He will hand you a letter that tells
you to go to the Taverne.  Do so.


 Taverne
 -------

   In the Taverne, right next to the owner, is... Francois de Bijou's
daughter!  You will have a chance to talk to her now.  Depending on your
choices, you can:

      1. Suggest they go "upstairs."  This will lose you -10 rep.
      2. Marry without her father's permission.
      3. Seek a title of nobility so you can marry with her father's blessing.

   If you would like to marry her WITH her father's permission, skip down to 
section XI.  If you want to marry her right away, without anyone's permission, 
sail to Omory and continue reading.


---------
  Omory
---------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Prior Modestus.  He will charge you 3,000gp to perform a secret
marriage ceremony.  After you pay, head to the Townhall in Belflor.


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Townhall
 --------

   You will find that the governor is not present, but Prior Modestus and the
governor's daughter are.  Modestus will conduct the secret ceremony.  You will
then be outside of the Townhall.  You should then re-enter and talk to the
governor, who is now there.  You will still need to complete the following 
quest, no matter which way you choose to get married.



==============================================================================
XI.   Preventing an Alliance
==============================================================================


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Townhall
 --------

   Ask de Bijou for his daughter's hand in marriage (if you have not married
her already).  He will give you a task in order to prove your worth.  If you 
succeed, you will be given both a title and his daughter's hand in marriage.
It seems that the English and Spanish are attempting to form an alliance
against France.  They are currently meeting at Aliando.  Your mission is to 
sail there and destroy the two ships thus preventing the alliance.


-----------
  Aliando
-----------

   You will face the Spanish Brig "Catalena" (Class 4) and the English Shnyava
"Styx" (Class 4) here.  You will receive 1,000xp and +2 rep for destroying 
them.  Now sail back to Belflor.

==============================================================================


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk to de Bijou.  He says that the King of France has made you an Admiral.
You also have a new task - Capture Costa Sinistra!  Leave the Townhall and
then immediately re-enter.  Talk to de Bijou again, and ask for his daughter's
hand in marriage.  He will finally consent.

                     -- SHORT MARRIAGE CEREMONY VIDEO --

   Now back to business.  Sail to Costa Sinistra.


------------------
  Costa Sinistra
------------------

   First of all, take out the cannons.  Each cannon that you destroy will earn
you 1,000xp.  If you can take out all of the cannons, you will receive
20,000xp.  You now have the option of assaulting the town.  When you do this,
you will be met by the town guard.  Typically, it is a force of between 500
and 999 men.  Use you fencing skills to defeat them.

   After you succeed in defeating the guard, you will enter the town. Talk to
the Honorable Citizen.  You will have two options:

      1. Loot the city.  You request 10,000gp before you will leave.
      2. Claim the island in the name of France.

   Obviously, you came to capture the island, so choose that option.  You will
receive 5,000xp and +1 rep.

   Now return to Belflor.



==============================================================================
XIII.   Capturing Highrock
==============================================================================


 Townhall

like for you to capture Highrock.  In addition, he will offer you a new ship, 
according to your current Rank.  You may choose to either make the new ship 
your own, or you can have it sail with you as an ally.


------------

   Now return to Belflor.



==============================================================================
XIV.   Pirate Ultimatum
==============================================================================


-----------
  Belflor
-----------


 Townhall
 --------

   Talk to de Bijou.  You will receive 10,000gp for the successful capture of
Highrock.  The governor will give you a letter, an Ultimatum.  You are to 
deliver it to the Pirate Chief.  If you press F1, and then look in your Chest, 
you will see the Ultimatum Note.  Click on it and you can read it.  It 
identifies Olaf Ulsson as the Pirate Chief.  On to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with Olaf Ulsson.  Tell him about the Spanish Ultimatum.  You will

==============================================================================


-----------
  Belflor

   Obviously, you came to capture the island, so choose that option.  You will
receive 10,000xp and +2 rep.  But wait, there is more to do here!  Remember 
the Old Woman whom you met a long time ago on Isle d'Orange?  The one who was 
looking for her ring?  Well, after you capture Isla Ballena, sail back to 
Belflor, but instead of Sailing to Island, turn around and return to Isla 
Ballena.  Enter the town.


 Taberna
 -------

   Talk to the owner.  He says that there is a girl in town named Francesca
who might have a ring matching the description you gave.  Leave the Taberna.

   For repelling the attack, de Bijou gives you 5,000gp.  He will also give 
you 10,000gp for having captured Isla Ballena.  He now sends you on your last

                   -- ENDING MOVIE FOR SPANISH CAMPAIGN --

   The game is not over yet.  Try playing through one of the other Campaigns.
The English, Spanish, and Pirates are waiting...





==============================================================================
                               PIRATE CAMPAIGN
==============================================================================

   As is true with the English, (and every Campaign) you begin your adventure
in Highrock.  You are free to do as few or as many of the English quests as
you want.  You also might want to talk to Samuel Mortons and get a LOM.  You 
can gain extra experience by completing some of his Quests.  Especially the
"Escorting Lemuelle Humm" quest.  What I did is I completed all of the English
Quests through the Defense of Itkal.  I then took on the Pablo Loco quest and
became a Pirate afterwards.  One quest that you probably should do is the
Pablo Loco & The Herb quest, as this gives you Dick Oakenwood, who will serve
as your Surgeon for free!!

   In the Preparation section below, I will include all the quests that you
can perform in Highrock at the beginning of the game.  I will then set the
stage for becoming a Pirate.  I will not include many of the Optional
English Quests, including the Lemuelle Humm quest.  See the English Campaign 
walkthrough for information regarding these Quests.



==============================================================================
I.   Preparations
==============================================================================


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to the guards at the town gate.  One of them would like some wine.
You will run into many people on the streets of Highrock  Be sure to talk with
Theodore and the Old Gunner.  They will teach you about game play basics, and
more importantly, you will receive 250xp for listening to each one.  Now head
off to the Tavern to find some wine.


 Tavern
 ------

   There are several more interesting characters to talk with in the Tavern.
You can hire Julius Ironcast as a Master Gunner, if you can afford his desired
wages.  You should also talk to the Fencer and Sailor.  They will teach you
more gameplay basics, and you will receive ANOTHER 250xp for each of them.  Be
sure to talk with Roberto Gorrando.  Tell him that you are a pirate, not a
merchant. He will tell you about a man named Adriano Montefi, who makes
wonderful Spyglasses.

     NOTE: If you do not talk to Gorrando in the Tavern, you will not be able
           to find Montefi later.

   Head over to the Tavern owner and talk business with him.  You will have to
pay 1gp for some wine, but it is worth every penny.  Now return to the guard.


 Streets
 -------

   Give the wine to the guard.  You will receive 250xp and +1 rep.  Talk with
the other guard, and he will reveal that he has a craving for...Rum.  Time to
go back to the Tavern.  On your way back, look for a man named Albrecht
Zalpher.  Talk to him, and he will hint at a new invention that he has.  DO
NOT ask about it.  Instead, suggest that he could work aboard your ship as a
Carpenter in order to escape Highrock.  He will agree and will join your ship.


 Tavern
 ------

   Once again, talk with the Tavern owner.  Follow the same conversation
string aS before with the wine, and this time you will be able to obtain some
Rum.  Now return to the guard outside.


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to the guard who wanted the Rum.  You will receive 250xp and +2 rep.
At this point, you should have 1,500xp.  Now, head to the Tendales.


-------------
  Tendales
-------------

   Once you arrive in Tendales, Albrecht Zalpfer will leave your ship.  You no
longer have a Carpenter, but you do receive 100xp.  Find Zalpfer on the
Streets and talk to him.  He will give you some Sketches for a new ship.

   At this point, there is nothing preventing you from sailing out to Shark 
Island and beginning your career as a Pirate.  However, it might be a good 
idea to stop by Dead Island and buy lots of indulgences from the
Priest (at least 35).  Once you become a Pirate, all ports will fire on you, 
but you will still be able to enter their cities (unless they are Hostile to 
you).

   If you want to get Dick Oakenwood, the free Surgeon, continue on.  If you
would rather just start your reign as a Pirate, skip to section III.

      If you want to get the free Surgeon, sail to Highrock.
      If you want to skip it and start your run as a Pirate, sail to Shark
      Island.



==============================================================================
II.   Pablo Loco & The Herb
==============================================================================


------------
  Highrock
------------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Doctor Alumnus.  You might have to talk to him two or three times.
He will ask you to find an herb for him.  He won't be able to pay you in gold,
but he will assign one of his students to work as a Surgeon on your ship - for
FREE!!!  There is also a Stranger roaming the streets.  Talk to him and he
will send you to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Streets
 -------

   Find Pablo Loco on the streets.  He will give you the herb that you seek,
but you must help him first.  Pablo needs some Tezhkataly wood.  This wood can
only be found in one place - Dead Island.

     NOTE: Your Reputation must be at least "Good Matey" or Pablo will not
           trust you, and you won't be able to get the quest.

   You will also encounter Raymond Ibelin on the streets.  You can hire him if
you want (and you will want to).  He is a First Mate.

     NOTE: Raymond Ibelin may not appear on Shark Island if you are not using
           the most recent patch.  If he is not here, you can find him on Isle
           d'Orange.


---------------
  Dead Island
---------------


 Store
 -----

   Talk to Nigel Fester.  Tell him you would like to buy some Tezhkataly wood.
He has some and is willing to sell it to you, but it will cost you 1,500gp.
Buy it, and return to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Streets
 -------

   Give the wood to Pablo Loco.  Not only will you receive the herb, you will
also get 500xp.  Now head back to Doctor Alumnus on Highrock.

 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Doctor Alumnus.  You will give him the herb, and he will tell you
that your new Surgeon is in the Tavern.


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk to Dick Oakenwood (hee, hee).  He will join your crew as a Surgeon who
will work for free!!!   Now sail to Shark Island.



==============================================================================
III.   Delivering the Idol
==============================================================================


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with James Callow.  He will tell you that he has come into the 
possession of a cursed Idol - the Idol of Khurukazelitipochtlie.  Whoever has
the item is cursed.  He would like for you to give the Idol to the most 
deserving man he knows - Beltrop.  Since Beltrop has also tried to kill you 
(if you took an English LOM and did the Lemuelle Humm Quest), you readily 
agree.

   You should now talk with Olaf Ulsson.  Ask to join the Brotherhood, and you 
will receive 1,000xp.  Next, ask him about a man from his past.  e will tell
you about Malcolm Sharp, your father.  Apparently, he was quite a reputable
Pirate himself.  He will mention three people who know him:  Dumb Nicky (who
is unfortunately deceased), Pegleg Berquist, and Maurikio Camentata, who lives
on Costa Sinistra.  Time to head on over to Gray Sails.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Tavern
 ------

   There are two men in the Tavern that you may hire, if you wish.  Dreyfus
the Fuse is a Master Gunner, and quite possibly the single best Officer in the
game.  He is also the most expensive.  You can also hire Jaque Dullarse as a
Carpenter, if you need one.

   At one of the tables is a Spanish Agent.  Talk to him and he will offer you
the opportunity to make restitution with Spain.  But it is not cheap!  It will
cost you 5,000gp, and -10 rep (if you took an English LOM earlier).  You must
do it in order to gain entry into Spanish towns and complete the next couple
of quests.  Once you are done, sail to Granda Avilia.  You will be able to
complete the Adriano Montefi Spyglass quest as well as find Maurikio Camentata
in the same quest, so I will put them both under Adriano Montefi's Spyglass.


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Pegleg Berquist.  He will be able to tell you more about your
father.  He can also give you information about a treasure that your father 
hid somewhere.  Now it is time to meet Beltrop!


 Townhall (gutted out ship)
 --------------------------

   Finally, you come face to face with Desmond Beltrop.  He seems reasonably
calm for having tried to kill you in the not-too-distant past.  Offer him the 
Idol.  He will ask if it is from you or from someone else.  Say it is from 
you.  Next, he will ask you what you want as a gift.  You can ask him for a 
ship.  When he offers you a Galleon, your best option is to say that those are 
ships for fat Merchants.  Now return to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk to James Callow.  He will reveal that he never had any intention of 
sailing with you.  However, he will reward you with 2,500gp.  Now you should 
sail to Costa Sinistra, in search of one of the men who knew your father.



==============================================================================
IV.   Adriano Montefi's Spyglass
==============================================================================

   Note that the quest for Montefi's Spyglass is Optional.  However, also 
contained within this section is the Quest that deals with one of the men who 
knew your father.  You will need to follow that part of the story in order to 
continue.


------------------
  Costa Sinistra
------------------


 Taberna
 -------

   Talk to the Taberna owner, Maurikio Camentata.  He will help you, but you
must help him first.  He would like for you to deliver a letter to Lorenzo 
Avido at Granda Avilia.  On the way, you should stop by El Caimano.

--------------
  El Caimano
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Adriano Montefi on the streets.  In order to make you a Spyglass,
he needs you to perform a task for him.  He needs some Crystals, which can be
found at the store on Granda Avilia.


-----------------
  Granda Avilia
-----------------


 Almacn
 -------

   Talk to the owner of the Almacn.  Give Lorenzo Avido the letter from 
Camentata.  You will receive 400gp for this.  He will ask you to deliver some
wine to Camentata.

   Next, ask him about Crystals.  He has them, and will give them to you for
500gp.  Now return to Montefi on El Caimano.


--------------
  El Caimano
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Adriano Montefi again.  You will give him the Crystals and he will
give you the Superior Glass (see the section of this document entitled Naval
Warfare for more information about Spyglasses).  You will also receive
1,000xp.  You should now head to Costa Sinistra.



==============================================================================
V.   A Treasure Map
==============================================================================


------------------
  Costa Sinistra
------------------


 Taberna
 -------

   Talk to Camentata.  He will tell you much about your father.  He will also
tell you that he has half of the Treasure Map that leads to your father's
treasure.  He will sell it to you for 1,000gp.  Buy it, and you will also
receive 3,000xp.  Now return to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk to Olaf about Malcolm Sharp and the Treasure Map.  He will point you
in the direction of Beltrop.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Townhall (gutted out ship)
 --------------------------

   Confront Beltrop.  Be bold, but do not threaten him.  You will not learn 
very much, except that Beltrop did indeed know your father.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with Olaf.  He is uncertain as to how you can make Beltrop reveal 
more.  In the meanwhile, he has a Quest for you.  He would like for you to 
hunt down and kill a merchant.  The merchant's name is Julio Nederedas, and he 
is aboard the "San Miguel".  You should be able to find him near Granda 
Avilia.  Finally, before you leave, question Olaf again about the Treasure 
Map.  Now, off the Granda Avilia.


-----------------
  Granda Avilia
-----------------

   When you arrive in the harbor, you will find the "San Miguel".  However, 
since you are both Spanish ships, you will lose -25 rep if you fire on it.  
Nevertheless, what Olaf wants...  Fire on the "San Miguel" (if you are
currently holding a Spanish LOM, you will have to fire on the ship from the
first-person mode).

     NOTE: Sometimes, the "San Miguel" is not here.  It is possible that you 
           have encountered and sunk it already.  It is also possible that it 
           is a bug.  If the ship is here, sink it.  If it is not, head to 
           Tel-Kerrat for your payment.



==============================================================================
VI.   Messing with Beltrop
==============================================================================


--------------
  Tel-Kerrat
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   You are supposed to meet up with Marcus "Tricky" here.  He is the one who
will pay you for sinking Nederedas.  When you talk to him, tell him that you 
sunk the "San Miguel" (even if you had the problem noted above) and you will 
receive 1,000gp and 500xp.  Talk to him again, and you will discover that his 
profession is that of a Forger.  Hmmm.  You can pay him 2,000gp and he will 
make a forgery of your half of the Treasure Map.

   Return to you ship, then immediately re-enter the town and talk to Marcus 
"Tricky" again.  He will have the false map ready for you.  You will also 
receive 1,000xp.  Now go and pull a fast one on ol' Beltrop.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Townhall (gutted ship)
 ----------------------

   Talk to Beltrop.  Suggest a trade of your half of the Treasure Map in 
return for information regarding your father.  Make him talk before you give 
him the map.  You will learn more about your father, including his dream of 
one day forming an independent nation of Pirates.  You will end up giving
Beltrop the Forgery in return.


 Tavern
 ------

   Enter the Tavern, and you will see a rare sight - a woman!  Talk with Anna 
Forge.  She is furious with Beltrop, and seems ready to try and kill him.  
She will ask you to hunt down and kill Juan Sangre.  You can find him at Isle
d'Orange.


-----------------
  Isle d'Orange
-----------------

   You will encounter the War Galleon "Aspirare" (Class 3) in the harbor.
This is Juan Sangre's ship.  Defeat him and you will receive 3,000xp and +3
rep.  Return to Gray Sails.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Tavern
 ------

   You will want to tell Anna Forge that you killed Juan Sangre.  When she
talks about killing Beltrop herself, you should dissuade her from this.  Tell 
her how much you want her to live.  She will have a surprise for you - the 
other half of the Treasure Map!!  You can now head to Telltak for some
treasure hunting.  But beware - Beltrop is aware that you tricked him, and he 
is out for your blood.



==============================================================================
VII.   The Gorgon
==============================================================================


-----------
  Telltak
-----------

   You will encounter Beltrop here.  It seems that there is more than one 
treasure, for Beltrop is sailing a Modernized MAn O' War!  Board it, and you 
will be able to duel with Beltrop himself.  He is not an easy opponent to 
defeat, and he likes to feint often.  Try and reduce his crew size as much as 
possible before boarding the "Gorgon".  Next, press Enter once.  This should
bring up the Sea Map option in the lower left corner of the map.  DON'T press 
Enter again.  Instead, sail around the island, as close to the beach as 
possible.  At one point, you will see that another icon has been added next to 
the Sea Map option.  It is the Land option.  Select it, and you will go 
ashore.



==============================================================================
VIII.   Past and Present Collide
==============================================================================


   You will find yourself in a cave.  Since there are no enemies, and the cave 
is not too complex, you should just keep walking around until you finally find 
your father's treasure.  Congratuations!!  Once you find the treasure, you
will be back in your ship.  Press F1 and select the Logbook option.  You will
have copied your father's Logbook into your own.  You can now read about the
final days of your father!  You should head to Gray Sails when you are 
finished.


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with Anna Forge.  Tell her that Beltrop is dead, and she will be VERY 
relieved.  You can also hint at a future that involves you and her.  When you 
are done, return to Shark Island.



==============================================================================
IX.   Stop the French Invasion
==============================================================================


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk to Olaf.  Tell him about the death of Beltrop.  Talk to him again.  He 
will tell you that the Pirates are weaker now that Beltrop is dead and others 
have fled.  The other nations have decided to use this chance to wipe out the 
Pirates.  You are sent to prevent a French invasion.  In addition, Olaf gives 
you your father's old flag!  On to Isle d'Orange


-----------------
  Isle d'Orange
-----------------


 Taverne
 -------

   Talk to the Drunk Officer.  He is one of the men who is supposed to invade 
the Pirate Islands, but he is not too confident about his chances for 
survival.  He mentions a man named d'Oriliaque who has something to do with
the invasion.  Perhaps he can help you.


---------
  Omory
---------


 Streets
 -------

   Talk to Aymeri d'Oriliaque on the Streets.  You can buy him off for
2,000gp.  In return, he will prevent the French invasion from taking place.  
Yippee!  Now, head back to Shark Island.



==============================================================================
X.   The Revolutionary
==============================================================================


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Tell Olaf that you managed to stop the French invasion.  He will inform you
that the English are now planning an invasion.  Oh, great.  You will need to
set sail for Highrock.  Before you leave, check to make sure that the English
are not Hostile toward you.  If they are, you need to buy the forgiveness of
the English.  You can also do that in this Tavern.  Just talk to the English
Agent.  Remember that it will cost you 5,000gp and -10 rep.


------------
  Highrock
------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with Jeremy McMellon.  He is a revolutionary who shares your father's
dream of an independent nation.  He will arrange it so that an English
invasion does not materialize.  Now head back to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Tell Olaf about McMellon and how you prevented the English invasion.  He
advises you to meet the new leader of Gray Sails, a man known as "Butcher 
Phil".



==============================================================================
XI.   Defend Gray Sails
==============================================================================


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Townhall (gutted out ship)
 --------------------------

   Talk to Butcher Phil.  He will tell you that there are two Spanish 
Lineships on their way to Gray Sails right now.  You must go out to the harbor 
and defeat them!


 Harbor
 ------

   Here you will encounter the Spanish Lineships "Trinidad" and "Milagrosa"
(Class 2).  You will receive +2 rep for taking out the two Lineships.  Once 
you defeat them, head back to Shark Island.


----------------
  Shark Island
----------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with Olaf.  He tells you that he is tired of being a Pirate.  He has 
decided to retire and sail back to England.  He leaves Shark Island in your 
hands.

           -- SHORT MOVIE OF OLAF ULSSON SAILING INTO RETIREMENT --

   It is time to see how McMellon can help you.  Back to Highrock.



==============================================================================
XII.   Surprise the English Fleet
==============================================================================


------------
  Highrock
------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with McMellon.  He requires 3,000gp in order to incite a revolution in
Highrock.  He also tells you that there is a fleet gathering at Dead Island.  
You should head there and destroy as many ships as possible.


---------------
  Dead Island
---------------

   You will find the English Frigate "Angel", the Brig "Falcon", and the 
Pinnace "Medway" here.  Defeat them.  You will gain +3 rep for this.  Head
back to Highrock.


------------
  Highrock
------------


 Tavern
 ------

   McMellon's revolution was a success!  When you reach the town, you will
notice that the Jolly Roger now flies above the fort.  The father's dream is 
beginning to become a reality - an independent Pirate nation.  McMellon tells
you that it will all be completed quickly.  Perhaps it is time to return to 
Gray Sails.



==============================================================================
XIII.   McMellon's First Letter
==============================================================================


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with Francis Dullarse, the Tavern owner.  He will give you a letter 
from McMellon.  To read it, press F1, then look in your Chest.  McMellon would
like for you to sail to Isla Ballena and take out as many ships as possible.  
You should also try and capture the island!


----------------
  Isla Ballena
----------------

   First of all, take out the cannons.  Each cannon that you destroy will earn
you 1,000xp.  If you can take out all of the cannons, you will receive
20,000xp.  You now have the option of assaulting the town.  When you do this,
you will be met by the town guard.  Typically, it is a force of between 500
and 999 men.  Use you fencing skills to defeat them.

   After you succeed in defeating the guard, you will enter the town. Head to
the Townhall and talk with Guilabertus de Muntral.  You will have two options:

      1. Loot the city.  You request 10,000gp before you will leave.
      2. Claim the island in the name of the new nation of Libertalia.

   Obviously, you came to capture the island, so choose that option.  You will
receive 10,000xp and +2 rep.

   Now return to Gray Sails.



==============================================================================
XIV.   McMellon's Second Letter
==============================================================================


--------------
  Gray Sails
--------------


 Streets
 -------

   Find and talk to Pegleg Berquist.  He will tell you that he had been
captured by the Spanish for a time.  However, McMellon rescued him.  Berquist
was given a letter for you from McMellon.  Read it in the same way as the
first letter.  In this letter, McMellon says that you should come to Highrock


------------
  Highrock
------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Talk with Jeremy McMellon.  He wants you to capture Granda Avilia and leave
a force of 200 man behind.


-----------------
  Granda Avilia
-----------------

   First of all, take out the cannons.  Each cannon that you destroy will earn
you 1,000xp.  If you can take out all of the cannons, you will receive
20,000xp.  You now have the option of assaulting the town.  When you do this,
you will be met by the town guard.  Typically, it is a force of between 500
and 999 men.  Use you fencing skills to defeat them.

   After you succeed in defeating the guard, you will enter the town. Head to
the Townhall and talk with Ricardo Ferrer de Mercadal.  You will have two 
options:

      1. Loot the city.  You request 10,000gp before you will leave.
      2. Claim the island in the name of the new nation of Libertalia.

   Obviously, you came to capture the island, so choose that option.  You will
receive 10,000xp and +2 rep.

   Now return to Highrock.



==============================================================================
XV.   Showdown at Isle d'Orange
==============================================================================


------------
  Highrock
------------


 Tavern
 ------

   Inform McMellon that Granda Avilia has fallen.  He will tell you that the
governors of Tendales and Belflor have fled!  Only Isle d'Orange remains.  At 
this point, check to see whether or not France is Hostile toward you.  It 
doesn't matter too much at this point, though.  Sail to Isle d'Orange.


-----------------
  Isle d'Orange
-----------------

   You should attempt to enter the town and speak with the governor, trying to 
convince him to surrender peacefully.  If this fails, or you are unable to 
enter the town, then you should attack it.

   First of all, take out the cannons.  Each cannon that you destroy will earn
you 1,000xp.  If you can take out all of the cannons, you will receive
20,000xp.  You now have the option of assaulting the town.  When you do this,
you will be met by the town guard.  Typically, it is a force of between 500
and 999 men.  Use you fencing skills to defeat them.



==============================================================================
XVI.   A Dream Fulfilled
==============================================================================

   After you succeed in defeating the guard, you will enter the town. Head to
the Townhall and talk with Guilabertus de Muntral.  He will concede defeat,
and even ask to join you in your cause - the cause of liberty.  Long live
Libertalia!

                   -- ENDING MOVIE FOR SPANISH CAMPAIGN --

   There is a different way to finish this Campaign.  Instead of sailing to
Isle d'Orange and capturing it, sail instead to Gray Sails.  There, enter the
Tavern and ask Anna Forge to marry you.  She accepts, and the Campaign will
end.  Unfortunately, you receive the same ending sequence both times.


   The game is not over yet.  Try playing through one of the other Campaigns.
The English, Spanish, and French are waiting...

==============================================================================


   Experience is very important in Sea Dogs.  With more experience comes
higher Ranks, which allow you to command better ships.  More Ranks also
provide you with more Skill Points, which help improve your chances at
success.  The following chart lists the number of experience points that
comprise each Rank, as well as what Class of ship you are allowed to sail
(without penalties) for each Rank.  Remember that the lower the Rank number,
the more powerful you are!

==============================================================================
                                 Store Prices
==============================================================================


   It is always a good idea to know the buying and selling prices of the goods
in Sea Dogs.  You will receive numerous trade items on many of the ships that
you board and plunder.  What could be better than heading to land and selling
your newly ill-gotten loot?  Knowing WHERE the best prices are!  The following
tables list the Store prices in every city in the game.  The Stores are 
arranged below according to the nation to which they belong, starting with 
English, then Spanish, French, and Pirates.

   The Stores are labeled differently, according to the language of that town.
To avoid any confusion, note the following words for Store:

                        Store - English, Pirate Towns
                        Almacn - Spanish Towns
                        Magasin - French Towns

   Be aware that there prices tend to differ slightly from game to game, as
the values are at least partly random.  However, if they are not exactly as
shown below, they will be close enough to not make a difference.  You will
still know where the greatest profits can be made.  In addition, the Goods
that are marked Importing and Exporting are always the same for each town.

   "Buy" is how much it costs YOU to buy that item.  "Sell" is how much the
store will buy it for.  "In Store" denotes how many of the item is available
for purchase.  "Import/Export" denotes whether the town is Importing or
Exporting the item.  These items are particularly good items to buy or sell.

                               Shipyard Prices
==============================================================================


   An alternative to capturing ships and then taking command of them is to buy
new ships at the Shipyards in select towns.  While this is not nearly as
exciting (or inexpensive) as capturing your own ship, it is still a viable
option.  Note that the most powerful type of ship, the infamous Man O War, is
NOT sold at any Shipyard.  You must capture one on the high seas (or cheat
somehow...).

   Below are the towns that have Shipyards.  All Shipyards sell and buy ships,
but each store carries different ships.  Not every Shipyard sells every type
of ship.  The towns that have Shipyards are:

                      Highrock            Belflor
                      Tendales            Isle d'Orange
                      Granda Avilia       Shark Island
                      Isla Ballena

   Below are the lists.  You will find the type of ship, its Class, and its
cost.  The Shipyards are divided according to nations:  English, Spanish,
French, and Pirate.  In the game itself, these ships will appear for sale
according to your Rank.  For example, if you are Rank 4, you will see all the
ships through Rank 3 on the list.  The stores will always show ships one Rank
higher than you can sail (without penalties).

                              Officer Statistics
==============================================================================


   There are many Officers in Sea Dogs who are looking for the right Captain
to serve under.  If you are willing to pay them, they will serve on your ship.
Each Officer will add to (or subtract from!) some of your Skills.  In addition,
the ever-valuable First Mate will allow you to take a Prize Ship after
successfully boarding a ship at sea.  This is about the easiest way to get
money in Sea Dogs.  First Mates do not come cheap, but they more than pay for
themselves.  Unless otherwise noted below, you automatically pay the Officer 
their first month's salary upon hiring them.

   You can only have one Officer for each position, no matter how many ships
are under your command.  The nationality of an Officer will not restrict you
from hiring him; if you are playing the English campaign, you can still hire
Officers that are in Spanish, French, or Pirate cities - assuming you can
enter the city! (you can not enter a city if that nation is Hostile toward
you.  This is the only restriction on the hiring of Officers)

   Below are the names of each Officer, where they may be found, the position
they will fill aboard your ship, the amount of money they are asking, and the
bonuses and/or penalties they will add to your ship.  The Officers are
organized below according to where they can be found, beginning with English
towns, then Spanish, French, and Pirate towns.

   Note that just because an Officer is located in a certain town does not
guarantee that you will be able to just sail there and hire them.  You may
only have access to them at certain points of the game, or after completing
one or more tasks and quests.  See the Walkthrough for more information.

                            Reputation Point Chart
==============================================================================


   Reputation is an important part of the game.  Besides giving you a neat
title on your Staff Screen, (by pressing F1) it also affects how long you are
able to withhold paying your crew before they mutiny.  In at least one known
instance, your Reputation can affect whether or not you can receive a quest.
The game does not display how many Reputation Points you currently have, but
this chart will provide you with some idea of how many you have.

   There are many ways to gain Reputation Points.  There are also a few ways
to lose them.  As is true in real life, it takes some time to build up your
Reputation, but it doesn't take much time at all to destroy it!  So be careful
in the decisions that you make.  Below is the chart of the amount of
Reputation Points and the corresponding title given to you on the Staff
screen.  Also provided are common ways in which you can gain (or lose)
Reputation Points.


                            Reputaion Points Chart
                            ======================

          Reputation Title              Amount of Reputation Points
         -----------------------------------------------------------
           -21 & below                      Horror of High Seas
           -11 thru -20                     Bloody Bastard
           -1 thru -10                      Cynic Swindler
            0 thru 4                        Neutral
            5 thru 14                       Plain Fellow
            15 thru 24                      Good Matey
            25 & above                      Hero of High Seas
         -----------------------------------------------------------
          How to Lose Reputation:
             Firing on a Ship of your Nationality          -25 rep.
             Changing your Letter of Marque                -10 rep.
            *Not Paying Crew Each Month (per refusal)       -5 rep.

          How to Gain Reputation:
             Completing Various Tasks, and Missions         varies
             Paying 100gp to the Priest on Dead Island      +1 rep.
         -----------------------------------------------------------
           * Careful! Your crew will mutiny at random if your
             reputation is Cynic Swindler (-1 rep) or worse.
             Mutiny equals death.
