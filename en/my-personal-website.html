<p>I had been really  wanting to try out several new design tricks, especially the creation of split  page website and a basic Progressive Web App. I was fascinated with the  possibility of creating a website with mobile app functionality that would also  function offline.</p>
<p>In 2016, the ability  to create and host websites with SSL became easier than ever, with my two  favorite options being the use of CloudFlare's free SSL and the use of free  Let's Encrypt certificates issued by more and more hosting companies. This  allowed me to create and implement my first Service Worker script, which  prompts a return visitor to the site to download the site (as an app) to their  screen. It also caches the website and allows for viewing even without a  connection!</p>

<p>The color palette was difficult to  define, but I was able to eventually find a color that I did not use too  frequently (too many blues and greens as of late). I settled upon<strong> #b14c3a</strong>,  which is not-quite red, not-quite orange. From there, I created a tetadric  color palette from that one color to obtain the blues, greens and browns that  can be seen on the Résumé / Work and Writings pages.</p>

<p>With regard to the text and fonts,  Source Sans Pro was selected as the universal site font. At the end of 2016, I  became more interested in fonts, typography, and text orientation in general.  Swiss (International) Style Design has always fascinated me, and after reading  an article about&nbsp;<a href="https://24ways.org/2016/css-writing-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS Writing Modes</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href="https://24ways.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24ways</a>&nbsp;website, I  elected to create a unique, vertical title for each section of the website. The  text is a simple semi-opaque black which blends with the color of each page's  header section.</p>
